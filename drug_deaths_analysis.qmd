# Number of deaths associated with drug use

---

- The ONS classifies death related to drug poisoning according to ICD-10 codes.
- Certain ICD-10 codes classify a death as a "drug misuse death".[^1] 
- Each of these requires a specific substance (e.g. heroin) or substance category (e.g. opioids) to be indicated either in the ICD-10 code or on the death certificate.


- There are deaths each year where the ONS holds no information on the substance(s) involved (see table 1).

| Year of death registration | All drug poisonings | Number of deaths without substance information | Percentage without substance information |
|----------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 2023                       | 5448                | 1245                                          | 22.9                                     |
| 2022                       | 4907                | 1239                                          | 25.2                                     |
| 2021                       | 4859                | 1219                                          | 25.1                                     |
| 2020                       | 4561                | 1050                                          | 23.0                                     |


Table 1: Number of drug poisonings deaths without substance information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Some of these will be classified as related to drug misuse where an ICD-10 code indicates mental and behavioural disorders due to drug use (excluding alcohol and tobacco) without a specific substance (e.g. F19 "multiple drug use and use of other psychoactive substances").

-   Others, coded as accidental/intentional self-poisonings or self-poisonings of unknown intent, will not be classified as related to drug misuse unless a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 was mentioned on the death record.

-   The data linkage between ONS mortality and NDTMS allows some of those deaths to be identified indirectly as related to drug misuse where the person that died had had contact with the drug treatment.

# Years of life lost due to substance use

---

- Years of life lost (YLL) is a measure of the impact of premature mortality, helpfully defined by Public Health England [here](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/static-reports/health-profile-for-england/definitions-regional.html#years-of-life-lost-yll).

- Chudasama et al. (2022) investigated five methods for estimating YLL.[^2] The first two methods are feasible with the available data for YLL from drug use and alcohol-specific deaths. Only the drug-related YLL could be segmented by geographical estimates of deprivation.

- All five methods are detailed in the supplementary PDF [here](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0895435622001639-mmc1.pdf).

---

The crude expected years of life lost is:

$$
YLL = (D_x)(e_{x}^s)
$$

Where \(D_x\) is the number of deaths and \(e_{x}^s\) is the standard age of death from the external life expectancy.

- Total YLL associated with drug use was **215,148**. 

- For comparison, Heald et al. (2024)[^3] estimated the impact of obesity on YLL in England at 791,689 in 2019.

- Deaths at ages between 35 and 54 accounted for 60% of the YLL.

## YLL method II

"Extend the basic formula and incorporate the discounting and age weighting requires a range of assumptions."

$$

Y_x = d_x \left[\frac{KCe^{r}(n^{a}x)}{(r + \beta)^2}(e^{z}[-(r+\beta)^{2}(e^{s}_{x} + a_{x}) - 1]) \right]

$$


The discount rate ($r$) is based on the concept that future mortality outcomes
have less value than the present mortality outcomes. The discounting rate is a
continuous and exponential function, therefore the higher the discount rate,
the lower the impact is in the future. The usual time for the discounting rate
is set at 3% per year. Age weighting is used because it enables the YLL
equation to value differently at various ages, i.e. the value of years lived
by a young adult could be noted to be worth more than that of a very young or
an old individual. So, the parameters were estimated at $C=0.1658$ and $\beta=0.04$
to account for this, which was calibrated and chosen from the 1990 GBD
study.[1, 2]
