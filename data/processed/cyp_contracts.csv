"Dorset Council","PAUSE Dorset",1519750.51,"Public Health Dorset are commissioning a delivery organisation to set-up a Pause Practice and deliver the Pause programme. Pause is a licensed programme that is delivered using a social franchising approach. This means that while the programme is delivered by a local delivery organisation it will look, feel and be branded the same as other Pause Practice's in the network.  

Pause is an evidenced based national programme for women who have experienced, and are at risk of experiencing, repeat removals of children from their care. The programme aims to give women the chance to pause and take control of their lives. 

The aim of the Pause service is to give women an opportunity and support to 'pause' and take control over their lives, to improve their wellbeing, resilience and stability. This helps them set in place strong foundations on which they can build a more positive future for themselves. 

The service will contribute to a reduction in future numbers of infants brought into care and the disruption of trans-generational cycles of poor outcomes experienced by some of the most vulnerable families in our community.

Women who experience repeat removals often have complex needs which are not currently being addressed.  They experience trauma and grief associated with the removal of their children, they may suffer from domestic abuse, mental health illnesses or substance misuse and they may have built up a mistrust towards children's social care services, resulting in poor engagement with existing support services.  

Tenders are welcome from:
1. Delivery partner - either a single provider model or a lead provider model (partners who wish to collaborate together for the provision of this service, where the contract is between the commissioner and the lead provider).
2. Social outcomes partnerships - a provider organisation(s) may seek to source and work with a social outcomes partnership/investment bond funding provider.

"Department for Education","(CF) Project: project_7939 - CR: Kinship Carer Training",2924771.02,"he services relate to the Department&apos;s aim to procure a package of training, information, support and advice for kinship carers in England. This is in response to the Independent Review of Children&apos;s Social Care (Care Review) call on Government to deliver a training and information package of support for kinship carers and their families.



Kinship carers are relatives or friends who raise children who cannot safely remain with their parents. Across the UK more than 150,000 children are living with kinship carers - significantly more than are in the care system and many more than are adopted, making kinship care an important element of the children&apos;s social care system.



These children have often suffered similar adversities to those in the care system. These include parental substance misuse or mental or physical incapacity, domestic violence, imprisonment, teenage parenthood, parental separation or death. Child protection concerns are common. At least 20% of children raised in kinship care are affected by some degree of emotional and behavioural difficulties1.



The charity Kinship&apos;s 2022 annual survey """"The Cost of Loving""""2, found that the provision of local authority support and information for kinship carers is inadequate, risking significant costs for children, families, and the state. The survey found that 78% of carers felt they did not receive the support they needed from their local authority in order to meet the needs of their kinship child(ren), an eight-percentage point increase on last year&apos;s survey. It also found that less than a third of carers received information about being a kinship carer before or shortly after the child moved in, and only 28% had been signposted to other places they could access support.



There is currently no national training and support offer for kinship carers, and what does exist is highly variable across different local authorities. Some organisations within the sector offer support, however none of that support is funded by the government. Some kinship carers attend foster carer training; however, the training isn&apos;t tailored to their specific needs (e.g. managing contact with a birth parent is different for a foster carer vs. a kinship carer).



Through this procurement we want to deliver on Governments commitment to deliver a training and support offer for all kinship carers by the end of this Spending Review (March 2025)."

There are high numbers of people with mental health, learning disability, substance misuse and other psychosocial vulnerabilities who enter the youth and criminal justice systems, who could be dealt with in the community, or diverted from the justice pathway altogether, as well as requiring early identification should custodial sentences be applied.

The aim of the L&D Service is to provide early intervention for vulnerable people (adults, children & young people) as they come to the attention of the criminal justice system.  The service will provide a prompt response to concerns raised by the police, youth offending teams, court staff or any other referral process (including self-referral), offering  critical information to decision-makers in the justice system, in real time, when it comes to charging and sentencing.  The service will also act as a point of referral and follow-up for service users, to ensure they can access, and are supported to attend, community treatment and rehabilitation appointments.
 
The primary focus of this service is improved outcomes for service users, not financial savings.

Key outcomes include:
•	Improved access to healthcare and support services for vulnerable individuals and a reduction in health inequalities, prioritising female detained persons and those under the age of 18.
•	Diversion of individuals, where appropriate, out of the youth and criminal justice systems into health, social care, education and training, or other supportive services
•	To deliver efficiencies within the youth and criminal justice systems 
•	To reduce re-offending and/or escalation of offending behaviours

The service specification expanded on these outcomes, outlining what commissioners required of providers through the life of the contract
 
The total contract value of Liaison and Diversion Services is £1,128,965 per annum, with a total contract lifecycle value of £3,386,895 over 3 years, and a possible extension of an additional 2 years.  The initial 3 year period will commence from 01 April 2020.

Vinney Green Secure Children's Home (SCH) is based in South Gloucestershire and accommodates up to 24 children and young people (CYP) of both sexes, aged between 10 and 17, at any one time. The population is transient (short average length of stay), dynamic (high rates of turnover), heterogeneous (varied reasons for referral and unique circumstances) and is drawn from a large population (CYP can be referred from anywhere in the United Kingdom). 

The home is licensed for operation by OFSTED and it contracts with the Youth Custody Service to provide placements for young people. It is subject to regular inspection by a range of government and local authority approved officials, to ensure the highest standards are maintained at all times. The home is managed by South Gloucestershire Council's Department for Children, Adults and Health. 
  
Length of stay in the Home is highly variable and some young people will start sentences that will see them transition to adult custodial settings. 

NHS England is responsible for commissioning all health services in the Home and for the clinical governance of the services provided. 

The healthcare services provision will include:
•	General Medical Services
•	Mental Health Services
•	Primary Care Nursing

•	Substance misuse services - Psychosocial and pathways to clinical treatment.
•	Screening and immunisation
•	Diagnostic services
•	Smoking Cessation Services
•	Management of long-term conditions

The procurement was carried out by NHS South, Central & West Commissioning Support Unit (SCWCSU) on behalf of the Commissioners. 

There are high numbers of people with mental health, learning disability, substance misuse and other psychosocial vulnerabilities who enter the youth  and criminal justice systems, who could be dealt with in the community, or diverted from the justice pathway altogether.

Across Avon and Somerset over recent years, two separate services have been in place to support these people, namely Liaison and Diversion (L&D) and the Arrest Intervention Referral Services (AIRS). These two services have been previously commissioned by NHS England and the OPCC separately. 

Realising there was significant cross over between the two services, NHS England and the OPPC commissioned a Health Needs Assessment in November 2016 to look across the provision available for vulnerable people entering the criminal justice pathway. One of the clear recommendations coming out of the needs assessment was for a single, integrated service to be commissioned. Working on this recommendation, a 12 week stakeholder consultation period commenced in June 2017. The findings of which helped to shape and inform the specification for the Custody and Courts Referral Service being commissioned.  

In developing a single, integrated service, the Commissioners are clear that efficiencies will be made, duplication removed and a more effective service will be delivered to vulnerable individuals.

The aim of the Custody and Courts Referral Service is to provide early intervention for vulnerable people (both adults and children and young people) as they come to the attention of the criminal justice system.  The service will provide a prompt response to concerns raised by the police, youth offending teams or court staff, and provide critical information to decision-makers in the justice system, in real time, when it comes to charging and sentencing these vulnerable people.  The service will also act as a point of referral and assertive follow up for these services users, to ensure they can access, and are supported to attend, treatment and rehabilitation appointments.

The contract duration will be for 5 years, with a commencement date of 1st April 2018.

The annual contract value is a range of £1,800,000.00 to a maximum of £1,950,000.00 (ex. VAT).

Over the lifetime of the contract the Commissioners are keen to introduce a deferred charging scheme, along the lines of the Durham Checkpoint scheme.
