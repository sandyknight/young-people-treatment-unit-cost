There are four elements to the training: Reading the book Managing Suicidal Risk, A Collaborative Approach, 2nd Edition, an online course, practical role play training and consultation calls.

Miscellaneous health services. Health training services. Community health services. Other community, social and personal services. Social work services. Medical practice and related services. Medical practice services. Provision of services to the community. Medical specialist services. Leicester City Council is seeking a clinically led services that aims to:
• protect the sexual health of the women working in the sex industry and their clients,
• prevent the transmission of STIs and HIV between these two groups and the wider community and to prevent unintended pregnancies. 
The work is with three distinct client groups. Outreach with 
• Women working in Saunas 
• Women selling sex from flats 
• Street based Sex work (SBSW)
It is acknowledged that access to SBSWs is difficult & requires the development of a trusting relationship. The provider may need to subcontract, work in a consortium or through a partnership with the local voluntary sector in Leicester who has knowledge and relationships for this element. 
Sex work refers to the exchange of sexual services for some form of payment, usually money or drugs. Over the last few years sex work has changed with a reduction in Street based sex work (SBSW). 
Sex work in Leicester is in three sectors; Street based sex workers (SBSW), Sex workers in flats and Sex workers working in saunas and massage parlours. The number of women involved in each of these areas of sex work fluctuates.
SBSWs have multiple and complex problems, most have substance misuse issues, which drive or exacerbate their need to earn money from selling sex. Health needs include substance addiction, mental & physical health problems. Many SBSW have been in the care system as a child. In Leicester the majority of SBSW are of white British ethnicity, with a small group of Eastern European women. The current voluntary sector service provider has built a relationship of trust over a number of years with SBSWs which provides insight and information that is useful to the police & others about the sex industry in Leicester.
Flat & sauna based women come from a variety of backgrounds, including Thai, Eastern European and white British women. Some will have complex health needs while others will live ordered lives with few exceptional health needs. Sexual health advice & information is important to all in this group. 
There is a gap in the provision of sexual health promotion & HIV prevention services to women in saunas and flats. 

The Tender seeks to secure a service Provider for the provision Sexual Health Promotion & HIV Prevention-Sex Workers.
The contract is to commence 1 April 2016 for an initial period of 33 months, until 31 December 2018 with the possibility to extend for a further 3 months until 31 March 2019 subject to satisfactory performance outcomes & agreement by the Council. The total contract value is £165,000"

"Wigan Council","Family Safeguarding Model",272640,"Wigan Borough Council Children's Social Care and the Wigan Safeguarding Children's Board have undertaken a review of models of social work practice during 2021 - 23 as part of improvement work linked to inspection by Ofsted and an increase in both referrals and the number of children entering the care system.  Following the review the Director of Children's Services and Director of Finance agreed a business case to implement Family Safeguarding as a model of social work practice which has a strong evidence base nationally in terms of the benefits to children, young people and families and the significant potential to reduce these key drivers/issues.

With Family Safeguarding, it is acknowledged that the issues facing families are complex and that no single professional group has the expertise to solve these alone.  The partnership establishes co-located multi-disciplinary teams that consist of adult specialist workers working alongside children and families' social workers, providing help and support in relation to parental problems associated with domestic abuse, substance misuse and mental ill-health. Motivational Interviewing is used as a unified model of practice that improves family engagement and encourages and supports lasting change. This will also bring the levels of consistent good practice that we are aiming for within Wigan as we work towards achieving a good and ultimately outstanding service for our most vulnerable children and families.  
 
The adult recovery workers are employed by the relevant partnership agency in the area and receive professional supervision by a lead specialist worker or a nominated senior manager in the partner agency. They undertake direct work with adults in the family to help them create lasting change through a family programme which is recorded in a digital workbook. Group supervision sessions summarise the work undertaken by the team and discuss the family's progress. Actions are agreed by the social work team manager; this is also recorded in the discreet workbook that is part of the model and enables all Specialist Adult workers working with the family to see the same plan and progress reports and to plan and sequence their involvements with families so that the right work is undertaken with the family at the right time through the team manager oversight.

This is a direct award following exemption approval."

"Sefton Council","Young people and family substance misuse Service- Sefton Council",864095,"Patterns of substance misuse among young people are changing, both in terms of reported prevalence and complexity of the problems faced by the young people who use services. While recent years have seen a decline in the number of young people recorded as entering specialist substance misuse services, substance misuse continues to be ranked as one of the five major challenges that young people face today with cannabis and alcohol remaining the most commonly reported substances for under 18 year olds with problematic use.

Substance misuse is seldom an isolated issue for young people. It affects their health and wellbeing, their education, their family, their security and their future. Substance misuse is closely linked to a number of risky behaviours, including risky sexual activity and multiple risk behaviours and vulnerabilities often associated with adolescence. 

Building resilience within an asset-based age appropriate model of Young People and Family substance misuse service delivery is central to enabling young people to develop the confidence and social capital that are protective factors against vulnerability to substance use and involvement in criminal activity.

Evidence suggests that specialist substance misuse interventions contribute to improved health and wellbeing, educational attendance and achievement, reductions in the numbers of young people not in education, employment or training and reduced risk taking behaviour, such as offending, smoking and unprotected sex. 

The lives of young people can be improved when their families (many of whom have complex needs themselves) are offered support and awareness of the negative affects their substance misuse while involving family members in treatment can improve positive outcomes and sustained behaviour change for young people and their families."

Heather Court provides a valuable resource to support young people to achieve full independence in Havering and is an important element of the wider portfolio of options for providing young people with supported accommodation. Havering has a need for supported accommodation for young people who are leaving care, at risk, offending or at risk of offending or misusing substances. Equally, young people leaving the family home after irretrievable family breakdown or abusive situations have needs of supported accommodation within Havering.
Heather Court remains strategically relevant for the Council because it provides a valuable resource where young people can be supported to achieve full independence. LB Havering seeks to retain this supported housing scheme as part of the wider portfolio of options for young people in Havering. The building, not directly a part of this contract, is still a valuable resource for the Council and this cohort of young people. Young people, with exception of those leaving care, are not given any priority through housing lists to socially rented properties and the private sector is largely closed to them
through lack of deposit, mistrust by landlords and general affordability criteria. Equally, many young people do not just require a housing solution but need support to help get their lives back on track.
Heather Court accommodates young people aged 16 (subject to guarantor agreement) to 25 years of age - the majority of current residents/service users are young people leaving care or young people at risk and are aged 21 or under and have a mix of capabilities. The support service is able to address a percentage of young people at any one time with relatively complex needs such as substance misuse, chaotic lifestyles and/or issues around offending or risk of offending. Experience suggests the specific mix of individual tenants at any given time can have a significant impact on the day to day management of the overall scheme. Residents at Heather Court are supported to stay safe and to achieve their desired outcomes
including gaining the necessary experience and skills required to move on to and be able to manage themselves in independent accommodation. To be eligible for this service, individuals must have an identified need for housing related support services and would
benefit from this service.

The total period of the contract is five years including extension (3+2)."

"Dorset Council","PAUSE Dorset",1519750.51,"Public Health Dorset are commissioning a delivery organisation to set-up a Pause Practice and deliver the Pause programme. Pause is a licensed programme that is delivered using a social franchising approach. This means that while the programme is delivered by a local delivery organisation it will look, feel and be branded the same as other Pause Practice's in the network.  

Pause is an evidenced based national programme for women who have experienced, and are at risk of experiencing, repeat removals of children from their care. The programme aims to give women the chance to pause and take control of their lives. 

The aim of the Pause service is to give women an opportunity and support to 'pause' and take control over their lives, to improve their wellbeing, resilience and stability. This helps them set in place strong foundations on which they can build a more positive future for themselves. 

The service will contribute to a reduction in future numbers of infants brought into care and the disruption of trans-generational cycles of poor outcomes experienced by some of the most vulnerable families in our community.

Women who experience repeat removals often have complex needs which are not currently being addressed.  They experience trauma and grief associated with the removal of their children, they may suffer from domestic abuse, mental health illnesses or substance misuse and they may have built up a mistrust towards children's social care services, resulting in poor engagement with existing support services.  

Tenders are welcome from:
1. Delivery partner - either a single provider model or a lead provider model (partners who wish to collaborate together for the provision of this service, where the contract is between the commissioner and the lead provider).
2. Social outcomes partnerships - a provider organisation(s) may seek to source and work with a social outcomes partnership/investment bond funding provider.

"Department for Education","(CF) Project: project_7939 - CR: Kinship Carer Training",2924771.02,"he services relate to the Department&apos;s aim to procure a package of training, information, support and advice for kinship carers in England. This is in response to the Independent Review of Children&apos;s Social Care (Care Review) call on Government to deliver a training and information package of support for kinship carers and their families.



Kinship carers are relatives or friends who raise children who cannot safely remain with their parents. Across the UK more than 150,000 children are living with kinship carers - significantly more than are in the care system and many more than are adopted, making kinship care an important element of the children&apos;s social care system.



These children have often suffered similar adversities to those in the care system. These include parental substance misuse or mental or physical incapacity, domestic violence, imprisonment, teenage parenthood, parental separation or death. Child protection concerns are common. At least 20% of children raised in kinship care are affected by some degree of emotional and behavioural difficulties1.



The charity Kinship&apos;s 2022 annual survey ""The Cost of Loving""2, found that the provision of local authority support and information for kinship carers is inadequate, risking significant costs for children, families, and the state. The survey found that 78% of carers felt they did not receive the support they needed from their local authority in order to meet the needs of their kinship child(ren), an eight-percentage point increase on last year&apos;s survey. It also found that less than a third of carers received information about being a kinship carer before or shortly after the child moved in, and only 28% had been signposted to other places they could access support.



There is currently no national training and support offer for kinship carers, and what does exist is highly variable across different local authorities. Some organisations within the sector offer support, however none of that support is funded by the government. Some kinship carers attend foster carer training; however, the training isn&apos;t tailored to their specific needs (e.g. managing contact with a birth parent is different for a foster carer vs. a kinship carer).



Through this procurement we want to deliver on Governments commitment to deliver a training and support offer for all kinship carers by the end of this Spending Review (March 2025)."

There are high numbers of people with mental health, learning disability, substance misuse and other psychosocial vulnerabilities who enter the youth and criminal justice systems, who could be dealt with in the community, or diverted from the justice pathway altogether, as well as requiring early identification should custodial sentences be applied.

The aim of the L&D Service is to provide early intervention for vulnerable people (adults, children & young people) as they come to the attention of the criminal justice system.  The service will provide a prompt response to concerns raised by the police, youth offending teams, court staff or any other referral process (including self-referral), offering  critical information to decision-makers in the justice system, in real time, when it comes to charging and sentencing.  The service will also act as a point of referral and follow-up for service users, to ensure they can access, and are supported to attend, community treatment and rehabilitation appointments.
 
The primary focus of this service is improved outcomes for service users, not financial savings.

Key outcomes include:
•	Improved access to healthcare and support services for vulnerable individuals and a reduction in health inequalities, prioritising female detained persons and those under the age of 18.
•	Diversion of individuals, where appropriate, out of the youth and criminal justice systems into health, social care, education and training, or other supportive services
•	To deliver efficiencies within the youth and criminal justice systems 
•	To reduce re-offending and/or escalation of offending behaviours

The home is licensed for operation by OFSTED and it contracts with the Youth Custody Service to provide placements for young people. It is subject to regular inspection by a range of government and local authority approved officials, to ensure the highest standards are maintained at all times. The home is managed by South Gloucestershire Council's Department for Children, Adults and Health. 
  
Length of stay in the Home is highly variable and some young people will start sentences that will see them transition to adult custodial settings.

•	Mental Health Services
•	Primary Care Nursing

The procurement was carried out by NHS South, Central & West Commissioning Support Unit (SCWCSU) on behalf of the Commissioners. 

There are high numbers of people with mental health, learning disability, substance misuse and other psychosocial vulnerabilities who enter the youth  and criminal justice systems, who could be dealt with in the community, or diverted from the justice pathway altogether.

Across Avon and Somerset over recent years, two separate services have been in place to support these people, namely Liaison and Diversion (L&D) and the Arrest Intervention Referral Services (AIRS). These two services have been previously commissioned by NHS England and the OPCC separately. 

Realising there was significant cross over between the two services, NHS England and the OPPC commissioned a Health Needs Assessment in November 2016 to look across the provision available for vulnerable people entering the criminal justice pathway. One of the clear recommendations coming out of the needs assessment was for a single, integrated service to be commissioned. Working on this recommendation, a 12 week stakeholder consultation period commenced in June 2017. The findings of which helped to shape and inform the specification for the Custody and Courts Referral Service being commissioned.  

In developing a single, integrated service, the Commissioners are clear that efficiencies will be made, duplication removed and a more effective service will be delivered to vulnerable individuals.

The aim of the Custody and Courts Referral Service is to provide early intervention for vulnerable people (both adults and children and young people) as they come to the attention of the criminal justice system.  The service will provide a prompt response to concerns raised by the police, youth offending teams or court staff, and provide critical information to decision-makers in the justice system, in real time, when it comes to charging and sentencing these vulnerable people.  The service will also act as a point of referral and assertive follow up for these services users, to ensure they can access, and are supported to attend, treatment and rehabilitation appointments.

The contract duration will be for 5 years, with a commencement date of 1st April 2018.

The annual contract value is a range of £1,800,000.00 to a maximum of £1,950,000.00 (ex. VAT).

Over the lifetime of the contract the Commissioners are keen to introduce a deferred charging scheme, along the lines of the Durham Checkpoint scheme.

reduce levels of drug and alcohol crime; reduce demand on social care; improve the lives of children of
parents with drug or alcohol problems; reduce the spread of infections associated with drug use; reduce
hospital admissions and increase the number of people entering employment and positively contributing to

"HAMPSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL","Support and Enablement Service North East Hampshire",12165344,"The Council requires a range of effective Support and Enablement Services across North East Hampshire. The Service Provider will work closely with the Council to develop an effective enablement offer that is outcomes focused and able to meet a variety of needs. 
The Service will be directed at Adults aged between 18-65 inclusive of young Service Users coming through transition (18 plus). Service includes Service Users with Learning Disability, Physical Disability, Mental Health issues, Substance Use issues and Autism Spectrum Conditions. Access to the services will be via a Care Act 2014 assessment. Most Service Users will be those who live at home with family or other carers or who live on their own. Some may have recently followed some level of transition where they have 'stepped down' from other accommodation-based services such as supported housing, extra care or residential care into their own accommodation.
Our overall approach is characterised by innovation and partnership working. It is important for the Council to have Service Providers that genuinely work in partnership with Service Users and the Council and who actively explore, present and deliver service innovations that better meet the needs of Service Users, the Service Provider and the Council. The Service will be person-centred and build on the strengths and assets of Service Users to create sustainable care and support solutions in community settings. These services will provide regulated activity, as well as a variety of skills development, vocational, occupational, social and leisure activities. Although 
the Service is not an assumed pathway for Service Users, there will be opportunities for deployment, so some Service Users may access more than one of the three contract areas. We recognise that services will change and evolve during the life of the contract, this requires organisations to work together in partnership. The Council requires a pro-active approach which embraces innovation 
including a digital offer that can help support this principle.

Only bidders who have been accepted on to the Hampshire Accommodation Development and Support Options Model (HADSOM) - Support and Care are eligible to apply to the call-off."
