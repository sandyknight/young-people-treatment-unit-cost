The contract end date is 31 January 2022, which is aligned to that of the overall Drug and Alcohol Recovery Service (DARS) contract with Humankind.

A procurement exercise was due to be undertaken in 2021 for the DARS, with the intention being to incorporate the requirement for cleaning services for the recovery centres within the new service specification.  However, as the DARS contract is likely to be eligible for the new NHS Provider Selection Regime that is due to come into effect from April 2022, an extension to the DARS contract of 18 months to 31 July 2023 was recommended and subsequently approved in June 2021 in order to maintain the current specialist cleaning provision.

The request is therefore to extend the incumbent contract from 1 February 2022 to 31 July 2023 to align with the extension period for the DARS, after which point the responsibility for cleaning of recovery centres will be included within the service specification for the DARS.

The Authority has four substance misuse contracts which includes the Integrated Camden Alcohol service. The intention was to recommission these during 2020 for new contracts to begin on 1st April 2021.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant impact on staffing levels across current and potential providers and capacity of the Public Health department and senior colleagues within the council. Operational delivery by current providers has prioritised safe delivery of frontline services which has required significant adaptation of services to ensure services are provided in a covid secure way and thereby protecting both service users and frontline staff.
Given the impact of COVID-19 The Authority has had to delay the planned procurement exercise. Three of the current substance misuse contracts have been extended to 31st March 2023 as allowed for under the terms and conditions. The Integrated Camden Alcohol service ends on 31st March 2022, so a new 12 month contract is required to co-align it with the three other substance misuse contracts whilst the recommissioning process takes place.
From Winter 2021, Public Health commissioners aim to collaborate with stakeholders and the market to help and develop an integrated drug and alcohol treatment system from April 2023. Notification of a market engagement event has been advertised on Contracts Finder (https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/2197891e-fb97-41bb-9724-c37490add5c8)

The Secretary of State for Education determined that there should be a 'transitional' (short-term) procurement based on current AEB policy to support learners until Further Education (FE) Reform policy embeds and to provide access for learners to the new National Skills Fund Level 3 adult offer. This procurement, for the 2021/22 academic year, will ensure continued access to funds for providers who have an important role in the adult education market helping to deliver the government's education and skills priorities and ensuring full coverage across England. It will also provide opportunities to support some of the policies associated with post Covid-19 economic recovery.

As a consequence of Covid-19, unemployment is expected to rise. The cohort of unemployed adults is now different compared to pre-Covid-19; many of them have skills and work experience but need support retraining and upskilling into sustainable, productive employment and the jobs of the future. Covid-19 has therefore expedited the need for people to reskill into sustainable, productive employment.

The Services to be delivered under the Contracts will support Covid-19 recovery and will be focused to support skills which boost productivity and enhance the adult skills system.",10:00

tender_304845/1251457,Contract,"Department for Education",Awarded,2023-08-30T12:08:26+01:00,"Adult Education Budget 2023 Procurement - ITT_2002 (Contracts for Services)","Existing ESFA-Funded AEB contracts for services came to an end on 31 July 2023 and therefore the Department for Education (the ""Authority"") was required to undertake a further procurement exercise to secure this provision.

The Authority, on behalf of the ESFA, conducted a competitive procurement exercise (carried out in accordance with the Light Touch Regime, applying the principles of the Open Procedure as set out in the Public Contract Regulations 2015) for new ESFA-funded AEB contracts for services. These contracts will commence on 1 August 2023 for an initial period of twelve months covering the 2023/24 academic year, with options to extend further by up to three 12-month periods (extension will depend on factors including individual supplier performance and government spending priorities  ).

Providers were required to meet the criteria and quality standards that were set out in the procurement documents.

The contracts awarded through this procurement exercise are for qualifications-based provision and/or their components described in the AEB funding rules and/or the Free Courses For Jobs (""FCFJ"") offer.

Multiple providers were sought to deliver the service across the non-devolved regions of England only. This means individual suppliers were limited to a maximum contract value, referred to as a &apos;tender cap&apos; according to factors including their experience of providing similar services and the size of the bidding organisation. Note however that the Authority did not guarantee that providers who were successfully appointed would necessarily receive funding in an amount equivalent to their applicable tender cap.

Separately to this, an overall maximum contract value of £2.5 million per year applied to each Provider (albeit subject to availability of funding/provider performance, the Authority may award funding beyond the afore-mentioned &apos;caps&apos; to providers if/when further funding becomes available and therefore annual contract values may increase in due course).

Following award, contract values may be increased or decreased according to factors including performance by the contractor and government funding priorities as were explained in the procurement documents.

Given the duration of the contract, the Authority may (at its absolute discretion) agree to variations in respect of the subject-matter of the courses delivered to the extent that such courses continue to fall within the auspices of adult education and the relevant funding rules as described above.

The procurement was open to providers who are seeking to deliver adult education and training provision funded by the ESFA AEB and FCFJ (and/or any other relevant public sector funding which may become available to deliver adult education programmes from time to time).

These sessions, delivered for up to 2 hours per learner, will consist of meaningful discussion, activity or workshop in which providers will be reducing negative attitudes towards maths and addressing barriers to participation whilst raising awareness of Multiply locally.  Identifying, where possible, clear progression routes into substantive learning activities through Multiply or the wider adult education offer to achieve the indicative indicators of Multiply.

Intervention a)  Substantive Learning Aims - Courses designed to increase confidence with numbers for those needing the first steps towards formal numeracy qualifications. 

This includes using best practice to engage new learners such as a cross-agency / partnership approach, working with local employers (for example, to deliver in-work confidence building courses), or the design of new teaching material.  We know that adults with poor numeracy are more likely to have had negative experiences at school and may have a ""fear factor"" in addressing their numeracy needs. That's why we want to see local interventions that help de-mystify maths by putting it into everyday, relatable, context; and help boost an adult's confidence to take the next step towards a qualification.

We would like to see a range of courses which have a specific purpose whilst being linked to numeracy skills such as those in the list below, although this is not exhaustive:

•	Cooking on a Budget
•	Money Management
•	Navigating Cost of Living Increase
•	Bespoke Numeracy related 'Clubs'
