The detailed requirements are defined in the Specification, but please see below summary for each Lot.

LOT 1: Structured Treatment Service for adults and young people in Northamptonshire will include prescribing, OST, psychosocial interventions and responsibility for the management of the residential rehab, inpatient and ambulatory detox, shared care with GP surgeries, needle exchange, supervised consumption with pharmacies, the distribution of naloxone and foil. It will also introduce an integral mental health service capable of meeting the needs of Northamptonshire clients; provide structured treatment for young people allowing them access to the specialist resources as needed and house the re-designed single point of contact (SPOC) representing all services.
LOT 2: Recovery Service for all treatment and recovery clients in Northamptonshire will be peer based and provide an interface with structured treatment. It will host mutual treatment options and include the management of the PHaSE housing project. 
LOT 3: Specialised Training Service, providing training on drug and alcohol awareness for substance misuse services for older people aged 45 and over.
LOT 4: Young People's Early Intervention Service - Services for young people with or living with problematic substance misuse will be divided into two. Those who require structured treatment (those with moderate to severe addictions) will be managed in the community by the Early Intervention service (Lot 4) with structured treatment drawn down from the all-through service (see fig.1). This configuration takes account of best practice, ensures that those who need treatment can access the best available with the interventions taking place within the young person's community environment. The Early Intervention service will comprise the larger part and will have workers embedded in clusters (schools or Early Intervention) where they will devise an appropriate prevention agenda for young people. It will support local services in the earlier identification of young people, at risk of, or substance abusing. It will provide assessment of the severity of the problem and steer the young person towards less harmful behaviours. Where the young person requires a more intensive treatment the community based early intervention service will draw down the practitioner and resources from the treatment service (Lot 1).

The service will be required from 1st April 2018 for an initial period of 4 years (up to 31st March 2022) with Lots 1, 2 and 4 having an option to extend for a further period of up to 4 years.

While recent years have seen a decline in the number of young people recorded as entering specialist substance misuse services, substance misuse continues to be ranked as one of the five major challenges that young people face today with cannabis and alcohol remaining the most commonly reported substances for under 18 year olds with problematic use.

Substance misuse is seldom an isolated issue for young people. It affects their health and wellbeing, their education, their family, their security and their future. Substance misuse is closely linked to a number of risky behaviours, including risky sexual activity and multiple risk behaviours and vulnerabilities often associated with adolescence. 

Building resilience within an asset-based age appropriate model of Young People and Family substance misuse service delivery is central to enabling young people to develop the confidence and social capital that are protective factors against vulnerability to substance use and involvement in criminal activity.

Evidence suggests that specialist substance misuse interventions contribute to improved health and wellbeing, educational attendance and achievement, reductions in the numbers of young people not in education, employment or training and reduced risk taking behaviour, such as offending, smoking and unprotected sex. 

The lives of young people can be improved when their families (many of whom have complex needs themselves) are offered support and awareness of the negative affects their substance misuse while involving family members in treatment can improve positive outcomes and sustained behaviour change for young people and their families.",,,North West,85000000,Stuart Bate,stuart.bate@sefton.gov.uk,7th Floor Merton House,Stanley Road,Bootle,L20 3UU,United Kingdom,'+44 1519344288,http://www.sefton.gov.uk/,,,,01/10/2017,31/03/2022,06/06/2017,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,1575000,1575000,18/07/2017,864095,[Addaction|EC1M 6PU|NONE||No|No],,01/10/2017,01/04/2020,Open ,,

HACK001-DN718722-64030236,Contract,London Borough of Hackney,Awarded,2024-04-16T13:16:00+01:00,Culturally Sensitive Substance Misuse Support,"Person centred, culturally sensitive, support for black people with substance misuse support needs. \r
London Borough of Hackney has seen significant investment in its Substance Use support system since 2021 through successive grant awards made by the Office of Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID). \r
\r
Funding for 24/25 is a part of the Supplementary Substance Misuse Treatment and Recovery Grant (SSMTR). This grant is a continuation and expansion of funding received in 23/24 and totals an approximate £2.9 million for the financial year. \r
\r
As part of the project the Local Authority needs to achieve clear aims in line with national outcomes, including increases in people accessing support services for dangerous and harmful substance use. \r
\r
In previous years the authority has achieved its aims through a programme focussed on underserved communities. This includes older black men, with Culturally sensitive provision provided by Support When It Matters (SWIM). \r
\r
Throughout delivery SWIM has demonstrably increased the number of older black men accessing support for services, and has played a pivotal role in increasing continuity of care from prison discharge into community services as well as providing outreach into areas of the community. This has been successful, and has led to the organisation and authority being included in Central Government best practice recommendations. \r
\r
In 23/24 SWIM piloted a self funded project to address the needs of Black women. Partners across the authority, including probation partners, have reflected the success of this approach through the Combating Drugs Partnership Strategy Group as well as Working Groups. These form key spaces in the governance of the overall substance use support system in Hackney. \r
\r
As part of the submission for the SSMTR the Combating Drugs Partnership, through the strategy group, agreed that a continuation and expansion of the SWIM project was necessary to help further increase the number of black people accessing, and benefitting from, drug treatment services within the authority area. \r
\r
A submission was made to OHID outlining this. OHID have agreed this funding and support the expansion/development of the service to meet the needs of all individuals in the borough who identify as black where there are barriers to accessing the core treatment service.\r
\r
This service falls within the scope of the Public Contract Regulations 2015. Consideration was given as to whether this service should be classified as a rehabilitation service and therefore within the scope of Provider Selection Regime (as a health service provided to an individual) but it was ultimately determined that as an outreach service focusing on a specific community and encompassing a wider range of support than health specific interventions this service should more appropriately be classified as a social work service (CPV code 85320000).",,,England,85310000,Maaz Hikmatulla,Maaz.Hikmatulla@hackney.gov.uk,Hackney Service Centre,1 Hillman Street,Hackney,E8 1DY,United Kingdom,'+44 2083563000,http://www.hackney.gov.uk,,,,01/04/2024,31/03/2025,01/02/2024,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,137680.28,137680.28,01/03/2024,137680.28,[Support When It Matters Enterprise|N7 8GE|NONE||Yes|No],,01/04/2024,31/03/2025,Open ,,23:59

Southend-on-Sea is a large urban conurbation and seaside town with a vibrant night time economy of pubs and clubs.  However, this environment brings higher levels of alcohol consumption, increased levels of risk-taking behaviour, alcohol and substance misuse, accidental injury, and violent crime.

The Provider will deliver the Service to meet the following Key Service Outcomes each year:
•	Provision of support in the night time economy from 10pm-5am every Friday and Saturday night (minimum of 103 sessions)
•	Provision of support for an additional 16 sessions (up to 7 hours per session), as identified by the Council 
•	Provision of at least 40 volunteering opportunities per annum, with comprehensive CPD packages and appropriate on-going supervision and support.

The provision of support will include, but not be limited to:
•	A responsive triage service leading to onward referral or any of the below;
•	The provision of first aid
•	Support to get people home safely (or to an alternative safe place)
•	Brief interventions on a range of relevant topics such as personal safety and alcohol
•	The provision of clothing/shoes 
•	The provision of condoms 

The aim of The Service is to improve support to those who have become vulnerable in the night time economy after alcohol or substance misuse. The primary aim is to provide immediate/short term support (e.g. first aid), however when appropriate opportunities to provide information and sign-posting to other support can prevent further harm.  

The contract term will run for 2 years from 1st April 2017 - 31st March 2019 with an option to extend for an additional period of 12 months. The latest expiry date of the contract will be 31st March 2020.

Southend-on-Sea Borough Council welcomes submissions from all organisational types, including the Third Sector.

IT-100-3920-PQ0441 - AWARD,Contract,Birmingham City Council,Awarded,2023-11-05T21:29:19Z,PQ0441 - Data Solution for Birmingham Drug & Alcohol Review of Deaths (DARD) Group  - AWARD,"Birmingham City Council (the Council) Public Health Division are commissioning a drug and alcohol-related deaths data recording, storage, and analysis solution. The successful supplier will also provide facilitation and administration of the bi-monthly Drug and Alcohol Review of Deaths (DARD) group. The successful applicant will need to collaborate with the Council's Public Health Division and with the members of the DARD group, with an overall aim of contributing to systematic work to prevent future deaths due to alcohol or drug use.
      
      The Council has recently consulted on the Triple Zero (Drug and Alcohol) Strategy which will be implemented while the provider is in post. The Triple Zero Strategy includes three key ambitions: zero deaths due to drug or alcohol addiction, zero overdoses due to drug or alcohol addiction and zero people unable to received support for their addiction when they need it. These are deliberately ambitious, as aiming for anything else would be a disservice to our citizens.
      
      The Birmingham DARD group meets bi-monthly, focussing on seeking opportunities to systematically prevent future deaths due to drug or alcohol use. Members include Public Health professionals, substance use service providers, substance use service commissioners, colleagues from the Coroner's Office, toxicologists, emergency services professionals and third sector organisations. Currently data collection, collation and analysis are done by one individual who works closely with the coroner's office. The current DARD focuses almost entirely on drug-related deaths and we will be increasing the focus on alcohol-related deaths as the new Strategy is implemented.
      
      The Council's Public Health Division are seeking a tool which provides a data solution and administrative meeting support for the DARD meetings. The successful provider will provide a bespoke cross-system data surveillance system which is suitable for use by all relevant DARD group members. The tool will be able to:
      
      i. Systematically record all deaths attributable to drugs and alcohol within Birmingham
      ii. Alert relevant stakeholders when a new death is recorded on the system
      iii. Produce reports on drug and alcohol related death data on demand
      iv. Provide a dedicated portal to access drug and alcohol related data for the Birmingham DARD group, and facilitate direct access to the tool for the relevant members
      v. The tool will not require routine administration by the BCC Public Health team; all routine administration will be the responsibility of the successful provider and data entry will be completed by the appropriate agency/professional or the successful provider
      
      This contract will be for a period of 2 years commencing May 2023 until April 2025.

A residential medically managed service is required for individuals wishing to realise a drug and/or alcohol-free life, but whose physical or mental health, family or social circumstances makes it unlikely that the person is able to realise this goal in a community setting.
The current service has been hosted and provided by Mersey Care NHS Trust as part of an integrated, recovery-orientated, substance misuse treatment system.  The service has been delivered against a service specification, moderated and performance managed since 2013 by Sefton Council.
From April 1st 2013 NHS Sefton ceased to exist and the Public Health function became the responsibility of the Local Authority. The responsibility for commissioning substance misuse services transitioned to Local Authorities at the same time.  All existing contractual arrangements were transitioned into the Local Authority and this contract was extended until 31st March 2016.  A further extension of three months has enabled a review of the balance between residential and community detoxification to be undertaken.  
In light of the above, Sefton Council is in the position to procure, through an OJEU Light-Touch Regime tender process, a residential medically managed detoxification service that meets local needs, in order to award the contract.  Submissions will be invited from suitably experienced and qualified organisations to deliver this service as the sole contractor.  Sub-contracting will not be acceptable, and will lead to a fail at the pass/fail section.  The bedded unit must be within 15 miles of the Sefton border in order to pass at the pass/fail section

clients engaged with substance misuse treatment services.

Following a pilot project, the Supporting Treatment, Accommodation & Recovery in Suffolk (STARS) provision was
commissioned as a contracted service in late 2012 in order to address the housing needs of those clients engaged with
substance misuse treatment services. Public Health are investing in the continuation of this service in order to build on the
evidence already gathered in order to measure longer term outcomes and gauge the impact on service users engaged with
STARS.
Whilst the primary focus of this service is to address housing needs and provide intensive support where required, there is
an expectation that the provider will also take into consideration the holistic needs of the client group. Opportunities to build
on social, physical, human and cultural capital, coordinated with substance misuse treatment providers will ensure the best
possible outcome for the client in their recovery journey.
The service covers two main elements, advocacy and support and intensive support. The county wide service will offer
advocacy and support in each of the three main localities (Ipswich, Bury St Edmunds and Lowestoft) to clients who are
considered to have a housing need via the STARS advocacy and support service. It is vital therefore that staff in the service
have an in-depth knowledge of the accommodation options available throughout the county and have experience of the
barriers facing this client group. The intensive support service will offer both high level support and suitable accommodation
to those clients with a long history of substance misuse who are unable to find accommodation elsewhere due to complex
needs. The service will offer tailored support to enable clients to achieve recovery from substance misuse and gain the skills
required to eventually live independently.
Suffolk County Council has decided not to divide the contract into lots so as to enable flexibility of funding and service
provision across the county according to service user need. The contract duration will be for 2 years with the option to extend
for up to a further 12 months.",,,East of England,85000000,Ashley Sale,ashley.sale@suffolk.gov.uk,"Suffolk County Council, Constantine House,  Constantine Road",,Ipswich,IP1 2DH,England,,,,,,01/01/2016,31/12/2018,01/09/2015,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,525000,876000,22/09/2015,525000,"[Genesis Housing|64 Pratt Street

\r
The reason the Council opted to pursue a D.P.S. was to enable the Council to remain in touch with this marketplace on a greater frequency than would be permissible under a Framework. The Council set out in 2022 that it aimed to re-open the opportunity for any potential providers that may have either :\r
\r
a)	joined this marketplace since the DPS was established, or \r
\r
b)	were in this marketplace when the DPS was established, did not opt to bid at the time of its formation, but have since developed an interest in providing services to the Council\r
\r
Re-opening the window of opportunity provides incumbent providers on the existing DPS to confirm their current commitment, and also enables a new proposal to be submitted should any incumbent provider wish to submit an updated proposal. \r
\r

Introduction 

With effect from 1st October 2017 Sefton Council established a Dynamic Purchasing System (D.P.S.) for the provision of Residential Substance Misuse Rehabilitation Services.

The Council informed the marketplace in 2017 that once established the Council intended to re-open the opportunity for any potential providers that may have either :

a)	joined this marketplace since the DPS was established, or 

b)	were in this market place when the DPS was established, did not opt to bid at the time of formation,  but have since developed an interest in providing services to the Council


The Council intended to re-open the DPS to any further potential Service Providers for approximately 2 weeks on the following dates :


a)	1st September 2018

b)	1st September 2019


The Council is now opening the 2nd Anniversary window. The 1st of September 2019 falls on a non working day, but also considering staff resource at the Council, it has opted to open it on 27th August 2019.",,,North West,85144000,Chris Magee,chris.magee@sefton.gov.uk,1st Floor Magdalen House,Trinity Road,Bootle,L20 3NJ,England,'+44 1519344069,http://www.sefton.gov.uk/,,,,24/09/2019,31/03/2020,10/09/2019,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,800000,800000,28/10/2019,800000,[Littledale Hall Therapeutic Community|LA2 9EY|NONE||Yes|No][Shardale Ltd|FY8 2NW|NONE||Yes|No][Liverpool YMCA|L3 6HU|NONE||Yes|Yes][Phoenix Futures|SE1 6DF|NONE||No|No][Good News Family Care (Homes) Limited|SK17 6PT|NONE||Yes|No][Holgate House|BB9 6AB|NONE||Yes|No][Acorn Recovery Projects|BB11 2ED|NONE||Yes|No],,01/11/2019,31/03/2020,Open ,,

SEFT001-DN509399-86689988,Contract,Sefton Council,Awarded,2021-02-05T11:18:20Z,The provision of a Residential Substance Use Medically Managed Detoxification Service,"In April 2013, responsibility for Public Health, including the responsibility for commissioning substance use and other specialist Public Health Services, passed to the Local Authority
Sefton Council intends to secure the services of experienced and suitably qualified organisations to deliver a residential medically managed detoxification service for substance users resident in Sefton.  A residential medically managed service is required for individuals wishing to realise a drug and/or alcohol-free life, but whose physical or mental health, family or social circumstances makes it unlikely that the person is able to realise this goal in a community setting 
The current service has been hosted and provided by Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust as part of an integrated substance use treatment system. The contracted service has been delivered against a service specification, moderated and performance managed since 2013 by Sefton Council and is due to expire on 30th June 2021
Sefton Council wish to procure, through an OJEU Light-Touch Regime tender process, a residential medically managed detoxification service that meets local needs, in order to award a new contract.  Submissions will be invited from suitably experienced and qualified organisations to deliver this service as the sole contractor.  Sub-contracting will not be acceptable, and will lead to a fail at the pass/fail section.  A residential bedded unit must be available within 15 miles of the Sefton border in order to pass at the pass/fail section.
This is due to the fact that service users will be residents of Sefton and it is believed that individuals are more likely to undergo a successful detoxification if they are able to maintain social and family networks during this critical treatment period. Additionally a significant number of individuals are likely to have either a dual diagnoses which require external medical treatment or may need contact with adult social care or housing support on discharge into the community, consequently a service within or close to Sefton is best placed to facilitate these improtant referrals.
This service will cater for adults 18 years and over and the value of the contract will include the cost of all medications required by the service user. The Local Authority would expect the provider to work with existing partners and use existing referral pathways that have been developed across the drug and alcohol treatment system including those between Adult Social Care, housing support services, hospitals and specialist health care providers, other residential detoxification services and residential rehabilitation programmes.

The service requirement  is offered in one Lot however there are 3 strands of expertise required from potential providers. These are; 

•	Child and Adolescent mental health services (CAMHS), 
•	Primary Care Nursing

The purpose of the service is to replace the services which are currently provided by three external providers for smoking cessation, and an internal substance misuse team, with a single, integrated holistic system. The new service will work with City residents and workers to raise awareness of risk taking behaviours to both prevent the need for treatment and prevent escalation to higher levels of treatment.
We intend to commission this under a lead provider model, allowing specialist providers to work together utilising their skills and expertise in each of the different areas. The service model therefore can be described as having 6 components. The components are designed to link and work together and it is the responsibility of the Lead Provider to make this happen. These include:
— Service Component 1 — Lead provider management function — Coordinating and performance managing the other components within the ISM&TCS;
— Service Component 2 — Prevention, Harm reduction and Awareness Raising — Pro-active targeting of residents and city workers, to raise awareness of risk taking behaviours, offer training and education and referral to treatment services where necessary;
— Service Component 3 — Custody Suite Drug and alcohol assessments — Drugs and Alcohol Intervention Programme (at police station) — both brief intervention and full DIP services;
— Service Component 4 — Substance Misuse Treatment — early engagement, treatment and recovery for residents, and appropriate referral to mutual aid support for non-residents across alcohol and drug misuse;
— Service Component 5 — Tobacco Control treatment level 2/primary care for both City residents and workers;
— Service Component 6 — Tobacco Control treatment level 3 for both City residents and workers.

Integrated Camden Alcohol Service,Contract,London Borough of Camden Council,Awarded,2022-03-14T15:31:39Z,Integrated Camden Alcohol Service (short term contract),"A  contract for twelve months has been awarded to the incumbent provider Change Grow Live (CGL) for the following reasons. 

The Authority has four substance misuse contracts which includes the Integrated Camden Alcohol service. The intention was to recommission these during 2020 for new contracts to begin on 1st April 2021.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant impact on staffing levels across current and potential providers and capacity of the Public Health department and senior colleagues within the council. Operational delivery by current providers has prioritised safe delivery of frontline services which has required significant adaptation of services to ensure services are provided in a covid secure way and thereby protecting both service users and frontline staff.
Given the impact of COVID-19 The Authority has had to delay the planned procurement exercise. Three of the current substance misuse contracts have been extended to 31st March 2023 as allowed for under the terms and conditions. The Integrated Camden Alcohol service ends on 31st March 2022, so a new 12 month contract is required to co-align it with the three other substance misuse contracts whilst the recommissioning process takes place.
From Winter 2021, Public Health commissioners aim to collaborate with stakeholders and the market to help and develop an integrated drug and alcohol treatment system from April 2023. Notification of a market engagement event has been advertised on Contracts Finder (https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/2197891e-fb97-41bb-9724-c37490add5c8)

BIP199859353,Contract,Leicester City Council,Awarded,2016-04-22T11:21:03+01:00,GB-Leicester: Sexual Health Promotion & HIV Prevention- Sex Workers,"Description: Health and social work services.

Medical practice and related services. Medical practice services. Provision of services to the community. Medical specialist services. Leicester City Council is seeking a clinically led services that aims to:
• protect the sexual health of the women working in the sex industry and their clients,
• prevent the transmission of STIs and HIV between these two groups and the wider community and to prevent unintended pregnancies. 
The work is with three distinct client groups. Outreach with 
• Women working in Saunas 
• Women selling sex from flats 
• Street based Sex work (SBSW)
It is acknowledged that access to SBSWs is difficult & requires the development of a trusting relationship. The provider may need to subcontract, work in a consortium or through a partnership with the local voluntary sector in Leicester who has knowledge and relationships for this element. 
Sex work refers to the exchange of sexual services for some form of payment, usually money or drugs. Over the last few years sex work has changed with a reduction in Street based sex work (SBSW). 
Sex work in Leicester is in three sectors; Street based sex workers (SBSW), Sex workers in flats and Sex workers working in saunas and massage parlours. The number of women involved in each of these areas of sex work fluctuates.
SBSWs have multiple and complex problems, most have substance misuse issues, which drive or exacerbate their need to earn money from selling sex. Health needs include substance addiction, mental & physical health problems. Many SBSW have been in the care system as a child. In Leicester the majority of SBSW are of white British ethnicity, with a small group of Eastern European women. The current voluntary sector service provider has built a relationship of trust over a number of years with SBSWs which provides insight and information that is useful to the police & others about the sex industry in Leicester.
Flat & sauna based women come from a variety of backgrounds, including Thai, Eastern European and white British women. Some will have complex health needs while others will live ordered lives with few exceptional health needs. Sexual health advice & information is important to all in this group. 
There is a gap in the provision of sexual health promotion & HIV prevention services to women in saunas and flats. 

The Tender seeks to secure a service Provider for the provision Sexual Health Promotion & HIV Prevention-Sex Workers.
The contract is to commence 1 April 2016 for an initial period of 33 months, until 31 December 2018 with the possibility to extend for a further 3 months until 31 March 2019 subject to satisfactory performance outcomes & agreement by the Council.

There are three key interventions: 0-19 Public Health Nursing; intensive structured support for young or vulnerable pregnant women; and addressing risky behaviour in young people (including treatment for drugs and alcohol problems).
Key outputs include delivery of the Healthy Child Programme through the provision of universal health assessments (including screening for overweight/obesity, auditory and visual problems), health promotion, early identification of health need and delivery of early interventions for some health issues. The system will also deliver targeted and intensive support to first time pregnant teenage women aged 19 years and under. The system will deliver a programme for the prevention of a range of risky behaviours and provide specialist support for the treatment of substance misuse (drugs and alcohol misuse), and work with lifestyle services to support smoking cessation.
This new system will be delivered by Health Visitors, School Nurses, Community Nursery Nurses, Screening staff, Family Nurses and Substance Misuse Workers to provide a seamless and integrated public health offer to Children and Young People in Derby City.
The system described within the specification will form an important foundation and serve as a gateway to a range of additional targeted and specialist services across the children’s health and social care system. The aim is for all levels of service to work together as one simple integrated system across Derby City, with clear links into Southern Derbyshire and Derbyshire County.
The initial contract period is three years; the contract is estimated to commence 1st April 2016 and expire 31st March 2019. There will be an option to extend the contract for two further years in annual increments, subject to satisfactory performance and business needs.

NSOMS001-DN428969-19563347,Contract,North Somerset Council,Awarded,2020-01-08T00:00:00Z,Adult Community Based Drug & Alcohol Treatment Service,"The Service will provide both pharmacological and psychosocial programmes for the addiction and dependence
to illicit substances and alcohol.
The Service will continue to have the overarching aim of reducing the harms caused by drug and alcohol use.
More specifically it will; prevent early mortality caused by drug and alcohol use; reduce levels of dependence;
reduce levels of drug and alcohol crime; reduce demand on social care; improve the lives of children of
parents with drug or alcohol problems; reduce the spread of infections associated with drug use; reduce
hospital admissions and increase the number of people entering employment and positively contributing to
the community. The Service will be key in supporting the attainment of the Government's goals of eradicating
homelessness and Hepatitis C.
The Service will target the full spectrum of substance use problems, from 'recreational' drug use and lower risk
alcohol consumption to severe poly-substance dependence. This broad focus will be reflected in the Service
adopting and combining both the harm reduction and recovery approaches to service delivery. It is expected that
the new Service will increase the level of attention given to early interventions (i.e. primary prevention).
The Service will continue to provide, within the scope of available funds, a holistic programme of treatment
and support, this will include such things as support for families and carers, physical health care, mental health
support, and access to training and employment programmes.
The Contract Manager has been working closely with a significant number of stakeholders involved to create
a specification that not only reflects the new budgetary requirements but allows the providers to consider how
they might best meet the outcomes defined by the Contract Manager. The specification will therefore be a hybrid
version of a requirement based specification and an outcome based specification. The Council believes that
Providers are best placed to design the service that best supports the required contract outcomes within the
parameters of the fixed contract price. 
The contract outcomes that the Council is seeking to achieve are detailed within the tender documents which are freely available on our procurement portal www.supplyingthesouthwest.org.uk. The contract term is 5 years with options to extend by a further 2 years. The contract start date is April 2020.

The joint venture procurement is being run involving East Suffolk District Council, West Suffolk District Council, Babergh District Council (BDC), Mid-Suffolk District Council (MSDC) & Ipswich Borough Council.(the council listed above') are based in central Ipswich Suffolk districts  )

      1. Purpose
      
      1.1 Population Needs
      National Context / Evidence Base
      Tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of ill health in the UK - and Suffolk - and there is clear evidence that by reducing prevalence of tobacco use that health and healthy life expectancy will improve within the population (ref GBD).   
      Smoking is a major cause of health inequalities, with smoking rates much higher among low-income groups and among adults with a mental health condition; around 40% of those with a serious mental health condition smoke. In 2019 around 1 in 4 (23.4%) of people in routine and manual occupations smoked, compared to only 9.3% of those in managerial and professional occupations. Smoking accounts for around half the difference in life expectancy between the richest and poorest groups (ref HNA).
      Smoking behaviour is primarily driven by addiction to nicotine; however, a wide range of personal, social, and environmental factors interplay with this addiction to influence who starts smoking, who continues to smoke and who gives up. Tackling smoking therefore requires a comprehensive approach which incorporates a range of public health interventions at different levels to tackle the individual, social and cultural influences on smoking behaviour. Reducing smoking prevalence and the use of tobacco can help local government to 1) cut costs to local public services, 2) protect children from harm, 3) boost the disposable income of the poorest people, and 4) drive improvement across key measures of population health.
      
      1.2 National Policy
      In July 2017, the UK government published 'Towards a Smokefree Generation - A Tobacco Control Plan for England'. This contained a vision of a smokefree generation (prevalence of 5% or lower) with a plan for action to reduce both overall prevalence and reduce the inequality gap in prevalence. Actions included a focus on prevention, supporting smokers to quit, eliminating variations in smoking rates and ensuring enforcement e.g., high duty rates for tobacco products.
      Additionally, The NHS Long Term Plan contained the following actions relevant to smoking:
      o By 2023/24, all people admitted to hospital who smoke will be offered NHS-funded tobacco treatment services.
      o The model will be adapted for pregnant mothers. 
      o A new universal smoking cessation offer will be available as part of specialist mental health services [2]

The aim of the project is to give people 'their own front door' providing stable accommodation with flexible support dependent on need; enabling individuals to develop the skills and motivation to maintain a tenancy and move on to permanent accommodation. 

The provider will be flexible and innovative in their approach to meet the needs of individuals. Acknowledging that progress within this group is often demonstrated by small but significant steps.

Support will address substance and alcohol misuse, offending behaviours, physical and mental health issues. The aim of this support is to prevent self -defeating behaviours, break the cycle of rough sleeping and sofa surfing thus creating a ""no wrong door approach"".   

Support workers will be experienced in psychologically informed practices. They will have the skills to build trusting relationships with service users and the local knowledge and expertise to link in with a wide range of services, including healthcare, mental health, substance misuse. They will also provide support to develop life skills such as budgeting, cooking, and ensure financial and digital inclusion. 

The provider will also provide an emergency on call out of hours service.

The marginalisation and stigmatisation of this group means it is essential the project works closely with the local community. 

The provider will support clients to contribute to the development of new and existing services.

The provider will attend Allocation Panel meetings which will consider referrals to the project and other accommodation funded by Next Steps Accommodation Programme (NSAP) and Rough Sleeper Accommodation Programme (RSAP).

This is achieved by providing safe and sterile injecting equipment, providing harm reduction advice and signposting drug users to structured treatment services, thus increasing the number of clients engaged in the treatment system, reducing negative health implications and reducing drug related deaths.
Clients accessing needle exchange services are also encouraged to return used equipment for safe disposal, therefore reducing the risk caused by discarded hazardous paraphernalia on the general public.

The service will provide short term housing support to 39 units of supported accommodation across 9 social housing properties in the borough and resettlement for residents who move on to independent accommodation.

The Provider will have the additional responsibility for carrying out housing management to furnished supported accommodation and to provide a flexible out of hours security concierge-type service.  These additional services will be funded through a Housing Benefit eligible rent and not the housing support contract.

Following an increase in the number of young people in need of supported accommodation and the predicted increase in demand, the current service requires remodelling to make best use of available properties, procure additional supported accommodation that can be used by young people and provide a planned and seamless journey towards independent living.  

To ensure that Looked After Children (aged 16 to 25 years), Care Leavers (up to age 25 years) and homeless young people (age 16-18) receive a well-planned service that leads to independence, this new service will be aligned with the Semi-Independent Accommodation Service to develop appropriate and effective pathways towards independence.

The service must be inclusive, balancing needs and managing associated risks of:

> Young people who are vulnerable due to age, immaturity, past experiences, emerging mental illness, substance misuse and/or vulnerability to sexual exploitation/abuse.
> Young people that present with challenging behaviour related to their past experiences, mental health and/or current substance misuse and/or anger management and/or offending

The Service offers support for individuals who have a history of entrenched rough sleeping, who may have a history of failed accommodation placements and/or have struggled to engage with previous offers of support.

When the Service User no longer requires Housing First support, the Service Provider will develop an exit strategy to ensure that the Service User can successfully remain in the accommodation provided. The Housing First support resource will be transferred to a new Service User.

The scope of the project is to provide a range of interventions that address and reduce the harm caused by the supply and use of heroin and crack cocaine in Hastings, East Sussex. The government's Shared Outcomes Fund is designed to test innovative approaches to address cross-cutting issues affecting society.  This includes funding totalling £28 million to help join up agencies to break up serious and organised crime gangs whilst tackling addictions due to a focus on drug misuse.  The Home Office will work with the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) and Public Health England (PHE) to pilot an intensive whole system approach to tackling drug misuse in select locations worst affected by drug misuse, alongside national activity to disrupt the supply of drugs.  Hastings has been identified as one of four pilot locations for this funding due to high rates of drug deaths and high rates of heroin and crack cocaine use.
      The care navigation service is being commissioned in order to provide support for those who are part of the Project Adder cohort to engage with the wider health and social care system. There is a strong evidence base which demonstrates the links between harm caused by opiate and crack use and the individuals with multiple complex needs within a community.  There is a low engagement rate with wider health and social care interventions within this cohort.  The wider health and social care system is vital in addressing the root causes of opiate and crack cocaine use.  The service provider will assemble a service which will support individuals to engage with the wider health and social care system in order to maximise and sustain their recovery from opiate and crack use and to minimalise the chance of relapse.  This will be achieved by the construction of a buddying system delivered by peers with lived experience of using services, overseen by a co-ordinator.

1137,Contract,London Borough Of Ealing,Awarded,2016-02-03T16:12:12Z,PROVISION OF SPECIALIST DRUG AND ALCOHOL TREATMENT SERVICES,"The RISE consortia (lead contractor is CRI) currently deliver a medical and psychosocial treatment service to adult substance  misusers in Ealing. The services were competitively tendered in 2012 to ensure value for money, by integrating provision of different elements of treatment and introducing peer lead elements to enhance recovery outcomes.
Ealing is categorised as having one of the most complex treatment populations with the least likelihood of achieving abstinence from alcohol and drugs. Notably Ealing’s performance has since the tender been consistently above the national average.

In June 2015 authority was given by Cabinet to extend the contract from 1st November 2015 until 31st March 2017. At the same time it was approved that the Public Health Drug and Alcohol Budget needed to be reduced by 30% between 2015/16 and 2017/18 as part of larger council efficiencies. Unexpectedly, in July 2015 the government proposed a further reduction of 6.2% to the Public Health Grant on top of the savings that have already been agreed. The contractor has expressed cooperation in frontloading the required savings already established for 2017/18 as well as achieving a further 6.2% budget reduction by 2016/17 if a direct award was to be granted with a minimum contract period of 3 years.

The current provider has a strong track record of performance and change management. However to achieve the required savings a service re-design will be required alongside the development of new models of service delivery/co-commissioning arrangements. 

The contract is currently due to expire in March 2017 and undertaking a competitive tender during this time period would not allow sufficient time to assess the potential negative impact of these savings on the treatment system as well as not allowing the necessary time to pilot new models which would potentially require the development of integrated health and social care commissioning arrangements with the CCG/other council departments. It would also bring repeated disruptions to the treatment system in 2016/17 and subsequent disruptions in 2017/18 if a competitive tender was to take place and a new provider was to be appointed.

A direct award would allow Public Health and the CCG to jointly explore the substance misuse provider becoming part of a multidisciplinary care delivery team and being co-located within the Primary Care Hubs that are currently in the planning stages and likely to be up established over the course of the next 3 – 5 years. 

This would also allow for an increased focus to be placed on early intervention and self-management to reduce the future demand on services as well as developing integrated health and social care packages for those with complex needs.

Any learning obtained during this period would be utilized for the development of the new service that would be competitively tendered and commence in April 2020.",,,London,85000000,David Suen,suend@ealing.gov.uk,"London Borough of Ealing, Public Health Directorate, 2nd Floor Orange, NW, Perceval House, 14-16 Uxbridge Road",,London,W5 2HL,England,,www.ealing.gov.uk,,,,01/04/2017,31/03/2020,01/02/2016,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,10017000,,01/02/2016,10017000,"[Crime Reduction Initiatives (CRI)|3th Floor, North West Suite, Tower Point, 44 North Road

575,Contract,Wigan Council,Awarded,2024-11-14T09:22:52Z,Family Safeguarding Model,"Wigan Borough Council Children's Social Care and the Wigan Safeguarding Children's Board have undertaken a review of models of social work practice during 2021 - 23 as part of improvement work linked to inspection by Ofsted and an increase in both referrals and the number of children entering the care system.  Following the review the Director of Children's Services and Director of Finance agreed a business case to implement Family Safeguarding as a model of social work practice which has a strong evidence base nationally in terms of the benefits to children, young people and families and the significant potential to reduce these key drivers/issues.

With Family Safeguarding, it is acknowledged that the issues facing families are complex and that no single professional group has the expertise to solve these alone.  The partnership establishes co-located multi-disciplinary teams that consist of adult specialist workers working alongside children and families' social workers, providing help and support in relation to parental problems associated with domestic abuse, substance misuse and mental ill-health. Motivational Interviewing is used as a unified model of practice that improves family engagement and encourages and supports lasting change. This will also bring the levels of consistent good practice that we are aiming for within Wigan as we work towards achieving a good and ultimately outstanding service for our most vulnerable children and families.  
 
The adult recovery workers are employed by the relevant partnership agency in the area and receive professional supervision by a lead specialist worker or a nominated senior manager in the partner agency. They undertake direct work with adults in the family to help them create lasting change through a family programme which is recorded in a digital workbook. Group supervision sessions summarise the work undertaken by the team and discuss the family's progress. Actions are agreed by the social work team manager; this is also recorded in the discreet workbook that is part of the model and enables all Specialist Adult workers working with the family to see the same plan and progress reports and to plan and sequence their involvements with families so that the right work is undertaken with the family at the right time through the team manager oversight.

The service will enable individuals to understand their mental disorder, identify their own key areas of strength and/or independence and live a life that matches their aspirations. It will promote resilience, purpose, autonomy, and the ability to make positive choices that sustain their wellbeing. Fundamentally, reducing risk to self/others and/or readmission to hospital.

Providers will need to be comprehensive and encompass all aspects of mental health to include physical, medical and psychological support.  Care Pathways will provide clear and timely assessments, assessing all needs to include those relating to risk from admission to discharge which are critical in avoiding duplication and preventing unnecessary delays.

People who will benefit from this service will be aged 18 years and over and may be:-

•	In or leaving Hospital (local acute wards and out of area hospitals including low secure estate)
•	Living with mental health in the community
•	Offenders who are at risk of causing harm to themselves or others
•	In treatment for substance misuse and mental ill-health
•	Using substances as a coping mechanism to manage their mental health and not currently accessing treatment support
•	Living in unsuitable accommodation

There should be no blanket exclusions to accessing the service.  However, people may be refused access to the service where providers can demonstrate an unmanageable risk is presented.  Where this is felt to be the case providers will be required to complete a Provider Support Assessment form to outline the reasons behind the refusal and whether there are any mitigating circumstances that would support their admission to the service. 

Referrals will come directly from the Housing with Care Team, following the Council's Accommodation Panel process, a single point of access for health professionals and adult social care workers based on need.  No self referrals will be permitted without a social care assessment.

The Police and Crime Commissioner is looking for a supplier to deliver an effective range of services to target a cohort of young people who are most at risk of criminal behaviour. This 12-month intervention will build upon some smaller scale work that has been undertaken in parts of the County but not all. Primarily the service will operate in Warrington, Halton and Cheshire East but will also be required to work in partnership with an existing service provider in Cheshire West and Chester who deliver a similar service around exploited young people (only). There is an expectation that the provider will work alongside this service provider and compliment their offer by supporting an extension of this service to include young people who are perpetrators of violent crime. 
-	Cheshire West and Chester have already commissioned a similar service in their area but only for victims of exploitation - the new provider will need to work with the existing provider to compliment that service and extending to meet the needs of young people involved in serious violence. 
-	The existing provider in Cheshire West and Chester is Queensberry AC. 
Following on from work across Cheshire around compliance with the Serious Violence Duty, we have developed a Serious Violence Needs Assessment and consequently we have developed strategy to address the issues identified. One of which, is young people at risk of serious violence or associated with exploitation, particularly around County Lines drug supply. Key issues associated with at risk individuals are frequent absenteeism/exclusion from school, often associated with societal risk issues around exposure to domestic abuse, substance misuse and mental health issues. 
The timescales for the delivery of this service are challenging. As such, it is anticipated that the successful provider will already have aspects of this programme ready for delivery with reasonable adjustments or have the expertise available to quickly use that knowledge to develop the relevant aspects. This needs to be ready for an April 2024 implementation.
Note: Due to the nature of the funding streams, there will be no extensions to the timescales for delivery of this work as such only those organisations that are utterly confident they can deliver in time should apply.
The Budget allocated for this scheme (initial 12 month contract) is £200,000
 The contract will have the facility to be extended up to 31st March 2029 (subject to available funding) to extend existing services and/or cover additional mentoring/group work to other wider but related cohorts.

tender_351179/1271272,Contract,Department for Education,Awarded,2023-11-28T09:55:53Z,(CF) Project: project_7939 - CR: Kinship Carer Training,"he services relate to the Department&apos;s aim to procure a package of training, information, support and advice for kinship carers in England. This is in response to the Independent Review of Children&apos;s Social Care (Care Review) call on Government to deliver a training and information package of support for kinship carers and their families.



Kinship carers are relatives or friends who raise children who cannot safely remain with their parents. Across the UK more than 150,000 children are living with kinship carers - significantly more than are in the care system and many more than are adopted, making kinship care an important element of the children&apos;s social care system.



These children have often suffered similar adversities to those in the care system. These include parental substance misuse or mental or physical incapacity, domestic violence, imprisonment, teenage parenthood, parental separation or death. Child protection concerns are common. At least 20% of children raised in kinship care are affected by some degree of emotional and behavioural difficulties1.



The charity Kinship&apos;s 2022 annual survey ""The Cost of Loving""2, found that the provision of local authority support and information for kinship carers is inadequate, risking significant costs for children, families, and the state. The survey found that 78% of carers felt they did not receive the support they needed from their local authority in order to meet the needs of their kinship child(ren), an eight-percentage point increase on last year&apos;s survey. It also found that less than a third of carers received information about being a kinship carer before or shortly after the child moved in, and only 28% had been signposted to other places they could access support.



There is currently no national training and support offer for kinship carers, and what does exist is highly variable across different local authorities. Some organisations within the sector offer support, however none of that support is funded by the government. Some kinship carers attend foster carer training; however, the training isn&apos;t tailored to their specific needs (e.g. managing contact with a birth parent is different for a foster carer vs. a kinship carer).



Through this procurement we want to deliver on Governments commitment to deliver a training and support offer for all kinship carers by the end of this Spending Review (March 2025).",,,Any region,80400000,Vicki Gregg,vicki.gregg@education.gov.uk,Unity Square,,nottingham,NG2 2GD,England,,,kinship final merged   REDACTED V2.pdf ,,,17/10/2023,31/03/2025,10/07/2023,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,2000000,9000000,17/10/2023,2924771.02,[Grandparents PLus t/a Kinship|The Foundry 17 Oval Way London SE11 5RR|COMPANIES_HOUSE|04454103|Yes|Yes],,17/10/2023,31/03/2025,"Other The Services that are the subject of this procurement are captured by PCR 2015, Chapter 3, Section 7 (Social and Other Specific Services), the so-called &quot;Light Touch Regime&quot;",,17:00

It is led, managed and delivered by The Pluss Organisation CIC across Somerset.

The initial term of this framework will be for 7 months from September 2023 to 31/03/24. Pluss reserves the right to extend this framework by a further year. Please note this contract allocation is for the contract area as a whole, and is not an assigned allocation to the individual specialist provider. This allocation will be accessed by the specialist provider on a needs basis per participant, as and when Pluss staff refer participants to the specialist provider.

Pluss wish to bring in specialist providers to deliver services that will help participants to overcome personal barriers to progression. As these services will be specific to the participants' needs, and sporadic in terms of the service requirements, to ensure a full coverage of services, Pluss is inviting specialist providers to apply to be on the Opportunities Framework as part of the Building Better Somerset Contract.

Once specialist providers are approved onto the Opportunities Framework, Pluss will be able to call off services on a needs basis per participant. The services are set out (but not limited to) the list under requirements (3) in the ITT document of this tender.

Please note, Pluss is not looking for one specialist provider to deliver all services across the area, services may be awarded to more than one specialist provider to suit the requirements of the programme.

Once approved and placed on the Opportunities Framework, this in no way guarantees a commitment to volume or revenue as the framework is there to be accessed on a needs basis.

The services under the Opportunities Framework will be very varied and for example, may range from a vocational training course to accessing help for substance misuse issues.  Due to this varied nature of services required under Building Better Somerset, there is also the scope to add services under None-Listed Services.

Adverts were placed on Contracts Finder and the Find a Tender Service and an Open procedure was undertaken in July 2022. No bids were received. 

Vinney Green Secure Children's Home (SCH) is based in South Gloucestershire and accommodates up to 24 children and young people (CYP) of both sexes, aged between 10 and 17, at any one time. The population is transient (short average length of stay), dynamic (high rates of turnover), heterogeneous (varied reasons for referral and unique circumstances) and is drawn from a large population (CYP can be referred from anywhere in the United Kingdom). 

The home is licensed for operation by OFSTED and it contracts with the Youth Custody Service to provide placements for young people. It is subject to regular inspection by a range of government and local authority approved officials, to ensure the highest standards are maintained at all times. The home is managed by South Gloucestershire Council's Department for Children, Adults and Health. 
  
Length of stay in the Home is highly variable and some young people will start sentences that will see them transition to adult custodial settings. 

NHS England is responsible for commissioning all health services in the Home and for the clinical governance of the services provided. 

The healthcare services provision will include:
•	General Medical Services
•	Mental Health Services
•	Primary Care Nursing
•	Public Health Programmes
•	Emotional Wellbeing services 
•	Contraception and sexual health advice services
•	Substance misuse services - Psychosocial and pathways to clinical treatment.
•	Screening and immunisation
•	Diagnostic services
•	Smoking Cessation Services
•	Management of long-term conditions
•	Health promotion and prevention

The service will facilitate access to community based secondary care services, including dentistry and optometry.

It is vital that there is continuity of provision for these services and, as there are no concerns with the quality or value for money of the current service, the Commissioner has taken the decision to re-award the contract to Avon & Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership Trust, the incumbent provider. 

The contract term will be for 7 years, with a total contract value of £5,875,000.00. 

The new contract is due to commence on 1st April 2023.

The Commissioner is awarding the contract under regulation 32(2)(a) of the Public Contracts Regulations.

Fusion ITTH61,Contract,LONDON BOROUGH OF HAVERING,Awarded,2022-09-09T11:47:48+01:00,Support to Independence Service at Heather Court,"Heather Court is owned by Look Ahead Care and Support (Look Ahead). It comprises 15 selfcontained units with onsite facilities for support staff. Placements at Heather Court are via referral (both from Havering's Leaving Care Team and external sources such as self-referral and other housing providers) discussed at monthly panel meetings. Heather Court provides a valuable resource to support young people to achieve full independence in Havering and is an important element of the wider portfolio of options for providing young people with supported accommodation. Havering has a need for supported accommodation for young people who are leaving care, at risk, offending or at risk of offending or misusing substances. Equally, young people leaving the family home after irretrievable family breakdown or abusive situations have needs of supported accommodation within Havering.
Heather Court remains strategically relevant for the Council because it provides a valuable resource where young people can be supported to achieve full independence. LB Havering seeks to retain this supported housing scheme as part of the wider portfolio of options for young people in Havering. The building, not directly a part of this contract, is still a valuable resource for the Council and this cohort of young people. Young people, with exception of those leaving care, are not given any priority through housing lists to socially rented properties and the private sector is largely closed to them
through lack of deposit, mistrust by landlords and general affordability criteria. Equally, many young people do not just require a housing solution but need support to help get their lives back on track.
Heather Court accommodates young people aged 16 (subject to guarantor agreement) to 25 years of age - the majority of current residents/service users are young people leaving care or young people at risk and are aged 21 or under and have a mix of capabilities. The support service is able to address a percentage of young people at any one time with relatively complex needs such as substance misuse, chaotic lifestyles and/or issues around offending or risk of offending. Experience suggests the specific mix of individual tenants at any given time can have a significant impact on the day to day management of the overall scheme. Residents at Heather Court are supported to stay safe and to achieve their desired outcomes
including gaining the necessary experience and skills required to move on to and be able to manage themselves in independent accommodation. To be eligible for this service, individuals must have an identified need for housing related support services and would
benefit from this service.

The screening and treatment for a MHTR are commissioned by the Health & Justice team, as part of NHSE/I London's Specialised Commissioning division.

The Service
The provider would screen women who had been referred by either Probation, Defence or Liaison and Diversion who are potentially suitable for a MHTR. If the individual agrees, this will be shared with Probation who will include the recommendation into the Pre Sentence Report for the Judiciary for them to consider whether a MHTR could be part of any sentencing options. Where a woman is given a MHTR as part of a community order the provider would deliver a number of sessions over a specified period, determined by the court and provide psychological treatment/interventions, to address the underlying mental health issues which may be contributing towards the underlying offending issues. The Provider will work directly with probation around support which will increase compliance, as well as proactively support the woman to comply with the MHTR, and therefore reduce breaches. This service would be available to any woman appearing in any of the Magistrates' Courts or Crown Courts in London.

The provider would be expected to work closely with Liaison and Diversion Services across London, as well as the Probation Service, Courts, substance misuse providers and third sector. Where a woman has additional needs, working with the Probation Service, will support her to access appropriate services to support her to address those needs.

Contract Length and value:

The contract for the Service will be awarded for a period of 3 years (36 months), with an optional extension for a further period of 2 years (24 months). Therefore, the maximum duration of this contract, if all extension options are taken up will be 5 years (60 months).

The maximum available annual contract value for this project is £620,000 per annum.
Over the 5 years, if contract is extended to its full duration, the total maximum contract value will be £3,100,000.
The annual payments will be subject to inflationary uplifts in line with published NHS national planning guidance.

SMD is defined within the programme as affecting people who experience at least 3 of 5 forms of disadvantage:
• Homelessness
• Substance misuse
• Mental ill-health
• Domestic and sexual abuse
• Interaction with the criminal justice system.
The Changing Futures Programme is commissioned by Nottingham City Council, in partnership with Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Clinical Commissioning Group.
The objective of the CF programme is to ensure that people living in Nottingham City who experience SMD receive joined up, flexible, person-centred care from the right services, at the right time, and in the right place to meet their needs. The focus of the programme is on achieving system change to enable the development and delivery of joined up services that provide effective healthcare, support and other forms of assistance to the most excluded, marginalised and vulnerable individuals who experience SMD. Partnership working is integral to delivering the CF programme and achieving the ambitions for system change.

The Main Delivery Service will encompass:
• Frontline Delivery Team
• Lived Experience Team
• Peer Mentors
• Activities Coordination
• Insight and Development Hub
• Practice Development Unit
• SMD specialist roles embedded within key partner agencies
• Housing Led Support Team

This independent advocacy service (the Service) will be available to beneficiaries of the Changing Futures Programme to support them to make and manage complaints, concerns or grievances (an Issue) in relation to any services they are entitled to covered by the Programme. This may be the Changing Futures Main Delivery Service, housing services, criminal justice services, domestic abuse services, sexual abuse services, recovery providers, training providers or any other relevant provision.

Aims of the Service
• To resolve Issues that people in Nottingham who experience SMD have with relevant services through the provision of an Independent Advocacy Service.
• To ensure that beneficiaries' experience influences the development and delivery of the Changing Futures Programme and associated service providers as a response to the issues raised through the advocacy service.
The key aim of this service is to enable current and future beneficiaries to access services that meet their needs.
By working with individuals, monitoring incidents of dissatisfaction, their causes and resolutions, the Programme will be able to influence change within its own services and those of other provider organisations.",,NG2 3NG,,85300000,Tin-Chi Lee,tin-chi.lee@nottinghamcity.gov.uk,"Loxley House,Station Street",,NOTTINGHAM,NG23NG,England,7927965409,,,,,01/07/2022,31/03/2024,01/06/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,78750,,22/06/2022,78750,"[Pohwer|Hertlands House

DORST001-DN588868-92096212,Contract,Dorset Council,Awarded,2022-06-23T16:24:58+01:00,PAUSE Dorset,"Public Health Dorset are commissioning a delivery organisation to set-up a Pause Practice and deliver the Pause programme. Pause is a licensed programme that is delivered using a social franchising approach. This means that while the programme is delivered by a local delivery organisation it will look, feel and be branded the same as other Pause Practice's in the network.  

Pause is an evidenced based national programme for women who have experienced, and are at risk of experiencing, repeat removals of children from their care. The programme aims to give women the chance to pause and take control of their lives. 

The aim of the Pause service is to give women an opportunity and support to 'pause' and take control over their lives, to improve their wellbeing, resilience and stability. This helps them set in place strong foundations on which they can build a more positive future for themselves. 

The service will contribute to a reduction in future numbers of infants brought into care and the disruption of trans-generational cycles of poor outcomes experienced by some of the most vulnerable families in our community.

Women who experience repeat removals often have complex needs which are not currently being addressed.  They experience trauma and grief associated with the removal of their children, they may suffer from domestic abuse, mental health illnesses or substance misuse and they may have built up a mistrust towards children's social care services, resulting in poor engagement with existing support services.  

Tenders are welcome from:
1. Delivery partner - either a single provider model or a lead provider model (partners who wish to collaborate together for the provision of this service, where the contract is between the commissioner and the lead provider).
2. Social outcomes partnerships - a provider organisation(s) may seek to source and work with a social outcomes partnership/investment bond funding provider.

It is led and managed by Pluss CIC and delivered by Pluss and its Core Partners across 5 Contract Areas.

There are specialist partners already signed up to this existing framework that opened in 2020.  New specialist partners are now being invited to join this framework that expires on 29/09/23.  Pluss reserves the right to extend this framework by a further year, or up to the date when the contract allocations per contract area are spent, whichever is the earlier.  Pluss also reserves the right to bring the expiry date forward, should the allocations per contract area be spent before the expiry date.

Pluss and its Core Partners wish to bring in new specialist partners to deliver services that will help participants to overcome personal barriers to progression. As these services will be specific to the participants needs, and sporadic in terms of the service requirements, to ensure a full coverage of services, Pluss is adding specialist partners to the existing Opportunities Framework as part of our extension on the Building Better Opportunities Contracts.

Once Specialist Partners are approved onto the Opportunities Framework, Pluss and its Core Partners will be able to call off services on a participant needs basis. The services are set out (but not limited to) under requirements (3) of this tender.

Specialist Partners can respond to one or more Contract Areas, but must complete a separate response for each Contract Area. Please note, Pluss and its Core partners are not looking for one Specialist Partner to deliver all services across any Contract Area, services within a Contract Area may be awarded to more than one Specialist Partner to suit the requirements of the programme.

Once approved and placed on the Opportunities Framework, this in no way guarantees a commitment to volume or revenue as the framework is there to be accessed on a needs basis. 

In addition, your organisation will be added to the pre-approved Pluss suppliers list. 

The services under the Opportunities Framework will be very varied and for example, may range from a vocational training course to accessing help for substance misuse issues, due to this varied nature of services required under Building Better Opportunities, there is also the scope to add services under None-Listed Services.

The Customer invites tender returns for the provision of ""Adaptive Delivery Models"" that will proactively map to the current and potential future needs of the forces working in collaboration with the Forces and the region as a whole to develop partnership working to provide the services required, over a TEN year period.
The Forces are looking to move beyond the constraints of a fixed delivery model that is determined by the Forces themselves and instead move towards a partnership approach.  
The intention is that this allows the contract to ""evolve"" with the changes in demand, legislation and technology to become an adaptive delivery model that proactively changes to better meet the delivery needs of each custody suite, and the wider forces themselves.  Allowing the cost of delivery to effectively represent the true cost of the service being delivered without sacrificing performance. 

The contract will be awarded to a SINGLE provider across the Entire FIVE Forces, who will then become a Strategic Partner to the Regional Forces.  In the earliest phase of the contract, the Provider will work with the Forces and other associated Detainee services to deliver the provision of Healthcare services to detainees to offer a regional service delivery that is adaptable enough to ""cross cover"" areas of high demand without sacrificing performance in another.  
In Later phases of the contract the Forces will look to work with the Strategic Partner to better integrate the services they provide, with those provided by the Liaison & Diversion, Substance Misuse Agencies, Mental Health and other connected service teams (incl VCSE's) that provide services to People who find themselves within or at risk of becoming part of the wider judicial System.

However, often these professionals do not feel they have the skills, knowledge or confidence to manage the suicidality of the people they support. Existing Suicide Prevention Training available in Hampshire and parts of the ICS (e.g. Suicide First Aid) is useful in managing one-off suicidal conversations but do not provide a therapeutic framework and the tools to work with a client on an ongoing basis. This has been identified by partners as a gap, via local Suicide Prevention Forums/Partnerships across Hampshire/Portsmouth/Southampton and Isle of Wight. In May 2021, Hampshire County Council co-ordinated a webinar about the use of Collaborative Assessment for the Management of Suicidality (CAMS) in the Solent NHS Psychology team, presented by Dr Lorraine Bell, Consultant Clinical Psychologist.

 HCC Public Health has worked with partners across the ICS and applied for a Health Education England grant on behalf of the ICS. The grant has been approved for CAMS. CAMS is based on the work and research led by Dr. David Jobes. It is based on the understanding that suicide risk is treatable and works to address the drivers that make someone want to die.

Emotional Wellbeing Services are Part of the NHS LTP for adult and older adults community transformation 2019-2024. Community mental health services are at the heart of the NHS Long Term Plan.  The Mental Health Community Transformation Programme looks to achieve radical change in the design of community mental health care by moving towards joined up care and whole population approaches, establishing a revitalised purpose and identity for community MH services. The programme aims to transform community-based MH services at a neighbourhood level. PCNs have populations at neighbourhood level and these footprints are the foundation for the new ways of delivering care.  The new integrated models of delivery will offer supportive and enabling interventions to people with a range of mental health needs from mild to moderate and severe, trauma related mental illness, and enduring mental health problems and dual diagnosis where alcohol or substance misuse is not the primary condition. 

This is a long-term transformation programme, expected to be delivered incrementally over a three-year period from 2021/22 through to 2023/24. In 21/22, a key initial stage is to test the new model of care with a group of PCN ""Accelerator"" sites, sharing learning gained with a view to implement across all PCNs' by 23/24. 

The intention is to expand this service across the 15 remaining West Sussex PCNs in 2022 and to increase the service capacity every year for the next 3 years, as directed by the National Long-Term Plan for adults and older adults in mental health. The proposal to directly award these contracts covers the first phase of the programme only. This direct award is being sought to meet urgent patient need for a service scheduled for April 2021, delayed due to Covid-19. The direct award will allow sufficient time to undertake a competitive procurement process to put in place a longer-term service for both the accelerator and non- accelerator PCNs.

Both Richmond Fellowship and Brighton Housing Trust as existing providers of mental health services, have an established relationship with the communities within these PCNs, and are therefore able to mobilise this service at speed. This direct award is made in the context of meeting patient need and delivering effective Mental health services in Primary care networks, reducing waiting times and supporting services users to maintain stability in their wellbeing and reducing  the need for admission into acute beds and secondary services, while also signposting people to services necessary for their needs.",,,South East,85100000,Sarah Rix - Senior Procurement Manager,sarah.rix@soeprocurement.nhs.uk,Sackville House (please send any communications by email to ensure receipt),Brooks Close,Lewes,BN7 2FZ,England,,,,,"Please note NHS England and Improvement have announced that the Sussex Health and Care Partnership, which is made up of all health and care organisations across East Sussex, West Sussex, and Brighton and Hove, has successfully met the criteria to become an Integrated Care System (ICS).

Supported Lodgings is a specific type of semi-independent accommodation, where a young person lives with a family/couple/single person (the 'Host') sharing their home. The young person is a member of the household, not a member of the family, but will share in some household/family experiences.
The young person is provided with safe and appropriate accommodation, guidance and support to help prepare them for living independently. The Supported Lodgings hosts work alongside and in conjunction with others working with the young person promoting their practical, social and emotional development, in keeping with the young person's Pathway Plan (or Support Plan if the young person is not a child looked after or care leaver).
It is envisaged that the young person will progress, developing new skills and confidence and the level of support offered by the host and Provider will reduce as the young person moves towards greater independence and the eventual move to independent living.
Aims and Objectives of the Service 
To develop and deliver an effective 'supported lodgings' service, which provides young people with safe, stable, semi-independent accommodation in nurturing family homes, supporting them to feel physically and emotionally secure at a time of significant change.
Providing young people with support to prepare them to move on to independence and accommodation that best meets their needs.
Provide consistent, trusting relationships for vulnerable young people to reduce their risk of exploitation as adults and minimise the impact of childhood neglect, abuse and/or trauma. The Host will model for the young person a positive way of living and engaging with the wider community/society. 
To respond flexibly to the needs of individual young people, to encourage them to develop independence skills, problem-solving capacity and emotional resilience.
To support and empower young people to make positive changes in their lives and establish healthy relationships with others.
To support young people to remain in or engage with education, employment or training.
To support young people and their families to return home if safe to do so.
To support young people to access specialist support for their additional needs, including substance misuse, emotional wellbeing and/or mental health, where required.
The initial contract term will be for 36 months with an option to extend for a further 24 months (in periods of no less than 6 months at one time) for a potential total contract term of 5 years as stated in the ITT documents. 
Estimated contract spend is between £600,000 and £1,146,000 across the initial 3 year contract term and between £1,000,000 and £1,910,000 across the potential total 5 year contract term.

We are a borough with a significantly high incidence of rough sleeping, currently the 6th highest total in London. We required a provider who can work with rough sleepers found bedded down in public places, on private land and in places like garages, stairwells, and vehicles. We required a provider who can rise to the challenge of helping a diverse rough sleeping population, of which up to two-thirds have no eligibility for public funds and amongst which many individuals have health and substance misuse issues. We do, however, benefit from the existence of key partners who work together, including through a well-established borough Homelessness Forum.
We need a provider which can operate an assertive outreach model, with a view to signalling clearly that rough sleeping is not acceptable and that engagement with sources of help is expected. The provider will also work with enforcement agencies, where the outreach offer is not effective and rough sleeping, with all its risks, persists. The contractor will be the main point of contact for rough sleepers in Ealing and will work with and forge strong working relationships with key local partners, in the statutory and voluntary sector. The provider will have primary responsibility for dealing with new rough sleeping reported via Streetlink but will work alongside initiatives like the GLA's Rapid Response Team, while these continue.
Success will be measured by the sustained reduction of rough sleeping, in line with government targets and our local Rough Sleeping Strategy. The provider is responsible for early intervention, a No Second Night Out approach, follow-up case work, minimising entrenched rough sleeping and achieving sustained accommodation outcomes and support for individuals. The provider will also have first refusal on hosting additional posts which might be created through government funding to assist in meeting the challenging target of eliminating rough sleeping by 2024.

The agreement is for a period of 4 years and 11 Months.

The weighted list size is 6 352 with an actual list size of 6 333 which is anticipated to grow in light of housing and population growth.

The practice is open 5 days per week, 8 a.m. - 6.30 p.m. Improved access arrangements are in place within the locality with patients having access to routine pre-bookable appointments between 8 a.m. - 8 p.m. on Weekdays, 8 a.m. - 1 p.m. Saturdays and 8 a.m. - 3 p.m. Sundays.

The new provider will be committed to continuous improvement in patient care and primary care services at the practice, developing strong collaborative working relationships with neighbouring practices to find local solutions to primary care matters impacting the Lowestoft area. The new provider must also actively engage with the development of the local primary care network.

The primary care network of which Kirkley Mill is a member comprises 7 practices covering a population of 85,100.

The practice serves patients living in one of the most deprived wards in Lowestoft. Life expectancy for males and females in this area is lower than the England average at 76 years for men and 81 years for women, compared to 79 years for men and 83 years for women (England average).

The latest CQC inspection was carried out in September 2019 and the practice is rated good overall, although requiring improvement in effective care; the practice was previously rated as inadequate overall in January 2017.

LPCoA&M1,Contract,THE LEARNING PARTNERSHIP FOR CORNWALL AND THE ISLES OF SCILLY LIMITED,Awarded,2020-05-20T08:48:04+01:00,Summative Evaluation of ESF Project,"The Learning Partnership for Cornwall & the Isles of Scilly is the Grant Holder for the Atlantic & Moor Working Together project which is part of The National Lottery Heritage Fund Building Better Opportunities programme.  The project comes under Priority Axis 1 - Inclusive Labour Markets, Investment Priority 1.4: Active Inclusion.



This £2.1m project brought together 56 Partners to support 750 economically inactive and unemployed adults from the Atlantic & Moor geographical area into education, training, job search and employment.  It is funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund and the European Social Fund. 

The Partners engaged and supported people with often complex and multiple barriers to work, to improve their health, wellbeing and finances.  This included those with mental and physical ill health, suffering sexual and domestic violence, substance misuse, learning disabilities and difficulties, housing needs and being offenders or victims of crime. 


 In addition to supporting people into training and work the project aimed to have a wider lasting impact on the participants, communities, Partners and stakeholders. 

The project has been delivered through the four following activities: 

1.	Engagement, assessment and planning 
2.	Support of soft skills
3.	Employability and employment 
4.	Post-employment support 

This is an exciting opportunity to assess the impact and effectiveness of the Atlantic & Moor Working Together project on participants and the wider community, which will also contribute to the development of best practice in future projects. 

The summative evaluation will need to set a baseline of what would have happened if the project had not taken place, that can be used as a benchmark. Methods should include: 

•	Desk research of the information provided by the Grant Holder
•	Online surveys of participants, partners and stakeholders
•	Face to face or telephone interviews with participants, partners and stakeholders
•	Focus groups with participants and community organisations

The delivery activity will be complete by December 2020 but some Partners will be completing their work by July and for this reason it will be necessary to interview Key Workers in May to catch them before they leave for other employment. 

The evaluation work and resulting report must be completed by December 2020. 

Selection will be made using a points-based analysis of a completed application form that will be sent to applicants on request or can be downloaded from this site. 

Covid-19

We would expect applications to include alternatives to face-to-face interviews, especially in the early stages of the evaluation when we will still be in a lockdown situation, and a timeline offering face-to-face interaction if and when this becomes acceptable later in the year, again with alternatives if this is not possible.",,,South West,80000000 98000000 ,Jude Robinson,jrobinson@cornwall-learning-partnership.org,"Redruth Centre, 5-6 Station Road",,Redruth,TR152AB,England,07939 393082,,Learning Partnership Atlantic  Moor - Project Plan (003).pdf A&M application.docx ,,,01/05/2020,18/12/2020,10/04/2020,YES,LPCoA&amp;M,Yes,Yes,No,Services,20000,20000,29/04/2020,20000,"[Perfect Moment|5 Parc Villas

There are high numbers of people with mental health, learning disability, substance misuse and other psychosocial vulnerabilities who enter the youth and criminal justice systems, who could be dealt with in the community, or diverted from the justice pathway altogether, as well as requiring early identification should custodial sentences be applied.

The aim of the L&D Service is to provide early intervention for vulnerable people (adults, children & young people) as they come to the attention of the criminal justice system.  The service will provide a prompt response to concerns raised by the police, youth offending teams, court staff or any other referral process (including self-referral), offering  critical information to decision-makers in the justice system, in real time, when it comes to charging and sentencing.  The service will also act as a point of referral and follow-up for service users, to ensure they can access, and are supported to attend, community treatment and rehabilitation appointments.
 
The primary focus of this service is improved outcomes for service users, not financial savings.

Key outcomes include:
•	Improved access to healthcare and support services for vulnerable individuals and a reduction in health inequalities, prioritising female detained persons and those under the age of 18.
•	Diversion of individuals, where appropriate, out of the youth and criminal justice systems into health, social care, education and training, or other supportive services
•	To deliver efficiencies within the youth and criminal justice systems 
•	To reduce re-offending and/or escalation of offending behaviours

The service specification expanded on these outcomes, outlining what commissioners required of providers through the life of the contract
 
The total contract value of Liaison and Diversion Services is £1,128,965 per annum, with a total contract lifecycle value of £3,386,895 over 3 years, and a possible extension of an additional 2 years.  The initial 3 year period will commence from 01 April 2020.

PR002038 -  Award Notice,Contract,"NHS SOUTH, CENTRAL AND WEST COMMISSIONING SUPPORT UNIT",Awarded,2018-01-22T09:52:17Z,NHS England South (South West) - Provision of Custody and Courts Referral Service across Avon and Somerset,"NHS England South (South West) as Lead Commissioner and the Avon and Somerset Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner (OPPC) as Co-Commissioner sought to jointly commission Custody and Courts Referral Service across Avon and Somerset. The procurement was carried out by NHS South, Central & West Commissioning Support Unit (SCWCSU) on behalf of the Commissioners. 

There are high numbers of people with mental health, learning disability, substance misuse and other psychosocial vulnerabilities who enter the youth  and criminal justice systems, who could be dealt with in the community, or diverted from the justice pathway altogether.

Across Avon and Somerset over recent years, two separate services have been in place to support these people, namely Liaison and Diversion (L&D) and the Arrest Intervention Referral Services (AIRS). These two services have been previously commissioned by NHS England and the OPCC separately. 

Realising there was significant cross over between the two services, NHS England and the OPPC commissioned a Health Needs Assessment in November 2016 to look across the provision available for vulnerable people entering the criminal justice pathway. One of the clear recommendations coming out of the needs assessment was for a single, integrated service to be commissioned. Working on this recommendation, a 12 week stakeholder consultation period commenced in June 2017. The findings of which helped to shape and inform the specification for the Custody and Courts Referral Service being commissioned.  

In developing a single, integrated service, the Commissioners are clear that efficiencies will be made, duplication removed and a more effective service will be delivered to vulnerable individuals.

The aim of the Custody and Courts Referral Service is to provide early intervention for vulnerable people (both adults and children and young people) as they come to the attention of the criminal justice system.  The service will provide a prompt response to concerns raised by the police, youth offending teams or court staff, and provide critical information to decision-makers in the justice system, in real time, when it comes to charging and sentencing these vulnerable people.  The service will also act as a point of referral and assertive follow up for these services users, to ensure they can access, and are supported to attend, treatment and rehabilitation appointments.

The contract duration will be for 5 years, with a commencement date of 1st April 2018.

The annual contract value is a range of £1,800,000.00 to a maximum of £1,950,000.00 (ex. VAT).

Over the lifetime of the contract the Commissioners are keen to introduce a deferred charging scheme, along the lines of the Durham Checkpoint scheme. This would require the successful provider to work jointly with Avon and Somerset Constabulary and other partners to develop and implement such a scheme.

LD services provide identification, assessment and referral of people with mental health and substance misuse/other vulnerabilities, whilst they are in police custody and courts, to appropriate community health and social care services.
The overarching of outcome of LD services is to support service users to engage or re-engage with health services as they re-enter the community from police custody and to make recommendations to criminal justice agencies including Police, Crown Prosecution Service and Courts as to possible community health interventions that will support service user needs and also reduce re-offending.

learning disability, alcohol/substance misuse, behavioural problems (resulting in

NT028P,Contract,NHS COMMISSIONING BOARD,Awarded,2015-08-18T09:15:56+01:00,Veterans Mental Health Pilot Services - NHS England,"NHS England commissions services for the armed forces and their families and in some circumstances services for veterans. These include prosthetics and mental health services.

In the Spring 2015 Budget, the Chancellor made available to the NHS in England additional monies for veterans mental health services to support the most vulnerable in the community.

The Forces in Mind Trust has recently undertaken research into veterans’ health needs; this has identified a number of gaps in service. NHS England is seeking Bidders to develop and pilot mental health services to address these identified gaps.

These pilot service contracts are split into 3 Lots as follows:

Lot 1 - Joint Substance Misuse and Mental Health Pilot for Veterans
Lot 2 - Severe PTSD Outpatient Service Pilot
Lot 3 - Overcoming Barriers to Mental Health Service Access for Early Service Leavers

NHS England (the Contracting Authority) expects each Contract to start before 31st October 2015 and they will run until 31st March 2016.

Each Contract/Lot will have a maximum permissible contract value of £400,000 (Ex VAT).

Bidders will not be limited in how many Lots they are able to bid for and the Contracting Authority may award multiple Lots to one Bidder (where Bidders express an interest in being awarded multiple Lots).

In light of the short term nature of the pilot contracts, the challenging timescales for mobilisation and service delivery and given the nature of the services themselves, the Contracting Authority has stipulated the following mandatory criteria for this procurement:

1) Voluntary Sector involvement - It is a mandatory requirement for Bidders to include a form of voluntary sector involvement in their service delivery proposals (see Section A questions for further details). The Authority will accept various forms of relationships including, but not limited to, Bidders who propose to subcontract services to, form a partnership with, or enter into a joint venture with, one or more charity organisations in the support of the delivery of the Services. 

2) Mental Health service providers – It is a mandatory requirement that a current provider of NHS-commissioned Mental Health services is involved in the service delivery alongside the successful provider in some capacity (i.e. as the Lead Bidder or a significant subcontractor) due to the knowledge, experience and other value that such providers would bring to these challenging, short-term pilot contracts.

The procurement process will adopt the “Open Procedure” as a template in that no formal Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) process will be followed.

RS-May15,Contract,Brighton & Hove City Council,Awarded,2015-04-27T09:47:09+01:00,Rough Sleepers Outreach Service,"The Brighton and Hove City Council is seeking offers for  the provision of a Rough Sleeping Outreach Service.

Rough sleeping has been rising on a national level. The Department of Communities and Local Government recorded an increase of 23% in England in 2010/11, which was then followed by smaller reported increases of 6% in 2011/12 and 5% in 2012/13. Brighton and Hove has followed a similar pattern, with rough sleeping increasing year on year from 2010 to 2013. Brighton and Hove’s 2013 Rough Sleeper Count was the third largest in England. In 2014, there was a slight decrease in rough sleepers but numbers remain high.

Rough Sleeping is a significant and visible issue in Brighton and Hove. Like many areas in the South East of England, the city faces a number of challenges, including a lack of affordable housing and strong competition for private rental accommodation. In addition to this, changes to the national cap on local housing allowance rates are also having an impact. In September 2014, with the exception of studio flats, the average rent for a property in Brighton and Hove was above the local housing allowance rate.

Local data indicates that Brighton and Hove has a high number of individuals without a local connection. Data also indicates that a significant portion of rough sleepers have complex needs, including substance misuse, mental and physical health issues and offending behaviour.

Due to 8 years of central Government underfunding, community drug and alcohol treatment services have been unable to offer the type of enhanced treatment options which achieve better, sustained recovery outcomes for people experiencing homelessness with substance use disorders.

Following the success of Everyone In during the first year of the pandemic in 2020, the Office of Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID), alongside the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUCH), launched a number of grant funded schemes targeting support for people rough sleeping. The Rough Sleeping Drug and Alcohol Grant is one of these grant funded programmes of work. Most recently this programme has been extended and will run up to the end of March 2025.

The City and Hackney were 2 of the authorities out of 60 in total awarded grant funding. The successful City and Hackney bid focuses on providing greater outreach through two dedicated rough sleeper community treatment teams, taking treatment to people sleeping rough. The second phase bid further includes a greater mosaic of clinical and service expertise most relevant to the needs of rough sleepers, such as more GP time, an alcohol specific nurse, a Speech and Language Therapist and Peer Health Advocates.

Overall, the project aims to engage more rough sleepers into all forms of treatment, from harm reduction, structured treatment, to detox and rehab. It requires local systems to provide an enhanced offer to rough sleepers which supports sustained longer term, improved health outcomes.",,,England,85000000 98000000 ,Maaz Hikmatulla,maaz.hikmatulla@hackney.gov.uk,Hackney Service Centre,1 Hillman Street,Hackney,E8 1DY,England,'+44 2083563000,http://www.hackney.gov.uk,,,,01/09/2024,31/03/2025,16/08/2024,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,56969,56969,16/08/2024,56969,"[Groundswell|Kemp House, 152-162 City Road, EC1V2NX, London, Greater London, EC1V2NX, United Kingdom|NONE||Yes|No]",,01/09/2024,31/03/2025,Other ,,23:59

The Service Provider will work closely with the Council to develop an effective enablement offer that is outcomes focused and able to meet a variety of needs. 
The Service will be directed at Adults aged between 18-65 inclusive of young Service Users coming through transition (18 plus). Service includes Service Users with Learning Disability, Physical Disability, Mental Health issues, Substance Use issues and Autism Spectrum Conditions. Access to the services will be via a Care Act 2014 assessment. Most Service Users will be those who live at home with family or other carers or who live on their own. Some may have recently followed some level of transition where they have 'stepped down' from other accommodation-based services such as supported housing, extra care or residential care into their own accommodation.
Our overall approach is characterised by innovation and partnership working. It is important for the Council to have Service Providers that genuinely work in partnership with Service Users and the Council and who actively explore, present and deliver service innovations that better meet the needs of Service Users, the Service Provider and the Council. The Service will be person-centred and build on the strengths and assets of Service Users to create sustainable care and support solutions in community settings. These services will provide regulated activity, as well as a variety of skills development, vocational, occupational, social and leisure activities. Although 
the Service is not an assumed pathway for Service Users, there will be opportunities for deployment, so some Service Users may access more than one of the three contract areas. We recognise that services will change and evolve during the life of the contract, this requires organisations to work together in partnership. The Council requires a pro-active approach which embraces innovation
